She doesn’t just skate the program…she moves THROUGH the music. That was exquisite to watch.
After watching this i can understand why she’s in 1st place. She definitely deserved that spot!
"She is like a swan on ice. The performance was emotional, technical and extremely clean. She is graceful when she skates."
I came here for the drama and stayed for the breathtaking performance. She skated her heart out
"Anna got the gold medal because she is the most balanced one, she made the least mistakes in the competition. Just like getting the highest mark  writing an exam. No need to compare valieva , Trusova, they are all cream of the cream."
"In her interview, Anna stated that she does not compete with anyone on the ice, but simply tries to skate as well as she is capable of at the moment. Her winning gesture at the end says just that, not that she already felt like an Olympic champion. This is the rare case when an athlete loves sports in herself, and not herself in sports!"
"Why does people on TikTok say she didn't deserve to win, she definitely did"
"After watching tons of clips overshadowing her win, I went to watch both of the 1st and 2nd performances. Gurrrrlllll, she totally deserve first place!!!

I don't even understand any of these technicalities or how hard those quads are but Anna looks so flawless! You can feel emotions and smoothness in every move and relaxed feeling as you watch her. You'll love watching her."
She didn't run for more more and more... Just perfected what she had! That's her secret of being a winner almost everytime
"honestly, anna has shown time and time again that she’s consistent with these jumps. she executed each one beautifully. she’s an extremely humble, and kind human, seeing how terrible people were to her makes me upset. she deserved this gold medal 100%."
That was one of the most incredible and engaging performances I’ve ever seen. It wasn’t dull for a second. She deserved to win
the ballet performance on the ice. Everything is just beautiful!
"She has countless fans in China, and Chinese fans call her ""Qian Jin"", which means noble and elegant girl."
"In fact I don’t even care she won gold. At the end you could see she was happy with herself. And knowing how Anna is hard on herself, this is 10x more important than wining the Olympics."
"I love her performance, humility and character. She's the best! Please stay in the sport for a very long time, Anna. Stay gold!"
"Too late for the beef but Anna def deserved to win. This performance still gives me goosebumps. She did it so gracefully. While, Sasha made history as well, you can feel her rage in her skating and eagerness to win that she didn't feel the music."
"Her whole performance is like a flow, she’s in one with the music. She did all technics beautifully, and combine it with the movement artistically. IDK about u but she deserves the gold."
"Anna is so hard on herself during training, and you can tell that her skating talent is not because she wants to win, but she genuinely enjoys it. She is graceful, technical and absolutely amazing. And the fact that she won is something much bigger. Sasha's performance was also amazing, but saying Anna didn't deserve the gold is like saying something like candy doesn't deserve its recognition."
"i just watched sacha's performance and now anna's and i understand why she won gold. despite the 5 quads, anna's performance was of a better quality. i hope to see them again in 2026."
"Аня балерина на льду, хрустальная статуетка, изящная, тоненькая как пушинка, грациозная, идеальная фигуристка во всем. Великолепно, блестяще каталась и в короткой и произвольной программе, заслужила золото, феноменальная чемпионка.
А какая обаятельная и доброжелательная, как достойно держится, как граммотно отвечает на вопросы на пресс-конференциях, и на английском тоже, не каждый взрослый так может ответить на вопросы. Талантливая,интеллегентная воспитанная девушка."
"Сколько про нее негатива писали, просто ужас. А девочка оказалась сильна ни только в катании ,но и психологически. Программы обе шикарно исполненны. Медаль золотая заслуженная на 200%!!! Столько труда в эту медаль вложенно. Вообще Аня обладает железным характером и очень устойчивой психикой, а также хорошим воспитанием!"
it's crazy how she could match her quads and triple with the music tempo......crazy talent.
Какая Анечка молодец. Эта девочка очень большой силы воли человек. Так собираться в самый нужный момент могут только великие спортсмены.
"Боже..когда смотришь эту программу в десятый,  двадцатый раз и думаешь, какая радость, что именно эта девочка,  заслуженно, стала ОЛИМПМИЙСКОЙ ЧЕМПИОНКОЙ....."
"Skill, elegance, expressiveness, endurance (both mental and physical), consistency... she got it all. Plus she looks like she is simply happy to be there and skate."
I hate people on Instagram saying she didn't deserve to be first
"No freaking wonder why she won, truly amazing"
"She's beautiful, elegant and her performance is simply amazing!! A well deserved gold medal winner!!"
The pure joy on her face when she finishes her program.
"Эта программа — флагман современного фигурного катания. Многие зрители даже не осознают, насколько эта постановка сложная. Чтобы так достойно её презентовать, нужно редкое сочетание отточенной пластики, быстрой умственной деятельности, хороших навыков актёрского мастерства и выдающегося технического потенциала. Здесь нельзя где-нибудь забыть движение руки, отпустить мимику, увести взгляд, и в то же время необходимо держать строжайший контроль над прыжками и другими элементами.
Всем этим невероятным набором качеств обладает именно Анна. И её победа — самое справедливое, что произошло на этой Олимпиаде."
"In my life, I have never seen something so technically demanding and precisely executed in combination with emotions. This is something unseen and unrepeatable."
"anna doesn’t deserve the hate she gets, her skating is so beautiful and artistic and she’s a very nice and classy girl! <3 if you hate someone who doesn’t even know you exist for “taking the gold” from someone who also doesn’t know you exist… then perhaps it’s time for you to see a therapist."
"She is incredible,  I think Anna deserved her gold medal"
"I have goosebumps..music , choreography all about this program is outstanding!"
"Пересматриваю  снова и снова , до слез, невероятное  , чистое  катание , спасибо Анечка"
"Красивенная Анюта! Тактичная, деликатная умница. Настоящая Принцесса."
"The level of professionalism in this performance both pre, during, and post is outstanding."
"I just want to say that Anna broke her skates three days before the women’s single skating, so she had to change them for new unworn ones. If someone doesn’t know, skates are the heart of every skater. So I don‘t understand how she landed two clean quads and skated the whole programme perfectly. Congrats Anna WOW"
"omg she definitely deserves the gold, the emotions through the art, I can feel it through screen, she did not perform for the judges to give her score but for every beat of the music, that was exquisite to watch reall, now I understand why she got 1st place, I Love Alexandra Trusova, her performance was exquisite too and so powerful, people are so unreasonably comparing these two women, they are amazing"
I know we all here to watch her performance but her facial expression is so eye-catching. It’s marvellous!
"Тоненькая , стройненькая , хрупкая , изящная, гибкая !!!!
Лебёдушка ты наша !!!
Вся в музыке , умничка !"
"This has been such a difficult season for Anna, with its highs and lows, especially with the arrival of Kamila in seniors. In spite of all of this (including breaking her leg at one point in her life), and the hatred of some people, she has risen from all of this and showed the world (and herself) who she is and what she can do. THIS is the mark of a true champion, who never gives up, and finds the courage and inner strength inside themselves. This is what Anna has done. She is a true inspiration. And this is her well deserved award. She has earned this highest of accolades. I'm so joyful, happy and very, very proud of her!"
"music, artistry, choreography, emotion, goosebumps = olympic champion. well done anna"
"Заслуживает это звание, красавица, пластичная, молодец, ещё переболела ковид девочка борец! Всех благ тебе Анечка! Наша Золотая!"
"She is really something!So beautiful, confident and positive, we like her not only outside, but inside!! Congratulation😃🥇"
"I have watched many different performances of many female skaters...but I have never seen such a perfect and beautiful performance before...this girl's movements are perfect...her facial expressions, her coordination of movements with the music, and her jumps are amazing...she definitely deserves a medal Gold more than anyone else. Another person... Do not let your feelings control you and direct hatred towards the hardworking person just because you do not like him or because he surpassed your favorite person."
"Лебедь на льду. Сама женственность, само изящество! Анечка так хочется видеть Вас на соревнованиях!"
Браво Аннушка !!!!шедевральное выступление
"Октябрь 2022 года, пересматриваю, наверное, сотый раз.
Сколько счастья, сколько радости после проката,когда Анечка ещё на льду! Она радуется, что откатала чисто, что выполнила все поставленные задачи. Вот что для этой невероятной девушки главное. Гордость наша."
"Certainly a gold medal performance. When you hear her interviewed you quickly realize she is very mature for her age.,, and it shows."
"Уже даже не знаю, в который раз пересматриваю... Аня, ты наша прелесть. Это олимпийское золотое катание. Спасибо за эмоции и радость!"
"Ань, до слёз. Это про вопреки и преодоление себя"
"She did it when it mattered the most always, I love her spirit and determined focused personality. she was exceptional always how she overcome the odds in her own team.... well done Anna ... your the most worthy Olympian Gold Medalist i have ever witnessed .."
"She's so kind and a fighter and an Olympic champion now, Congratulations Anechka well deserved and we are happy for you ❤️💕🌹💐"
I cannot stop replaying it. Thank you to Anna for her beautiful performance and congratulations on the gold!
"I'm here after watching the performance of Silver winner, now I understand why Anna won Gold. She was performing throughout on ice."
Anna is the most beautiful figure skater in the world. And she was 100% clean in both her short program and free skate. A most worthy World and Olympic Champion. She is so well spoken and intelligent too
A fantastic performance. That gold medal was well deserved.
"Анечка, как же ты прекрасна!
Уже октябрь 2022, а я пересматриваю твое выступление и каждый раз восхищаюсь!
Какая грация, пластика, артистизм, точность движений!
Спасибо тебе, Анечка, за этоь праздник!
Наша олимпийская чемпионка!"
"When she was about to go to the Olympics, a reporter asked her “Why do you think you deserve to be part of the Olympic team?” EVERYONE underestimated her. But she gave her all and proved them all wrong"
"This was a rough season for Anya, injuries, not at her best, but she peaked at the perfect moment and gave us these stunning, beautiful performances. I still watch her WTT skate from last year and I’ll be adding this one to my list. Just incredible, congrats on the well earned gold medal!"
"I think that those people who were questioning her about whether she deserved to be on the Olympic Team were served their papers on this night.  Well done, Anna, and well deserved!"
I don't have any contact points with figure skating or ice skating at all...but she catched me with her performance and personality. Joy to watch.
"She mix between Technical and Artistic. Emotional in every movement. I follow her carry after Alina Zagitova who bring me to this sport retire. I see her happy and sad. everything make her strong as we see now.

Congratulation Anna The new Olympics Champion. 🥇⛸🌟✨❄️

Big love from Thailand 🇹🇭💞🇷🇺

Sorry about my english but i write from my warm heart. ☺️"
"Anna is a fighter. when they doubt her, it is precisely when she wins. She is the Russian skater who can withstand pressure skating the most"
She deserve the gold. Just finished watching the video on Trusova. This girl has the elegance and artistry on top her technical skills.
"4:46 That was so majestic. Her performance still gives me goosebumps. I felt the emotion, elegance, and grace. It didn't even feel like I'm only watching her skate it that makes sense."
"Анечка, без тебя померкло и поблекло российское фигурное катание... Спасибо тебе за твой труд и за сказочный балет на льду . Ты непревзойденная звездочка наша!!!"
"It's even more impressive when you consider she apparently did this with an injury and using rental skates. Not only was this the Olympic gold performance, she got the gold with the highest score to date. Shouldn't have been a surprise since she won nationals with pneumonia.
""Shcherbakova Iron Will"" indeed. 

She's recovering from knee surgery now, but doubt that'll stop her seeing as nothing else has. Regardless, I admire her... stronger person than me or most. Little PR genius too, if you've seen her press conferences. She'll have lots of success to come.

Support and best wishes from Canada! 👏🇨🇦"
"Пересматриваю многократно и не перестаю удивляться! Хвалят других, а Аня представляет программу очень музыкально,  артистично, красиво...сама нежность!!! Будь благословенна, дорогая Анечка!"
Умница Анюточка! Какая же ты фарфоровая статуэточки наша! Молодец!
I'm always  happy to watch an athlete deliver the best performance they can without being overcome by the pressure of competition. I admire that mental strength. She seems to have enjoyed her performance as well. I'm glad I got to see this video :)
シェルバコワは技術、表現力、しなやかさ、聡明さ、美しさを兼ね備えた素晴らしい選手🤗⛸️✨✨✨💯👸✨✨✨ 男性でも高難度の４回転フリップからの連続ジャンプは見事！！
Anya delivered when it mattered the most. Thats what i love about her. This program is such a beautiful program and i'm glad that they made this program an olympic program.
I just watched Ana's full performance.. her movements are very light and with emotion in the background of the music.. so she really deserves to win. she's cute and her smile is so kind.
"МОЛОДЕЦ! На одном дыхании смотришь катание Анны Щербаковой. Не замечаешь сложности, а она ведь делает четвертные! ВЫСШИЙ ПИЛОТАЖ!"
"I have never watched figure skating before. Seeing both of her performances at this Olympic, I admit that she really captivate me into her performances. She is very talented, very musical, emotional and artistic skater. Fabulous skating and well-deserved Olympic champion."
She really knows how to win the big games. Congrats!
Her skating’s gorgeous ❤
She seems like such a sweet person 🥺 I’m so happy she won because she seems so humble and kind
"Всегда мечтала золотую медаль именно для Анечки!! Она волшебная!!!  Очень рада за нее, заслуженная победа!!"
"Настолько мне понравились обе программы Ани! В самое сердце!!! Утонченно,нежно и так все чистенько,не к чему придраться)"
"I've watched this over and over. The music, the program, the artistic elements and her technique, this is pure art.  It's so beautiful."
"Меня поразила история с коньками Анны - все журналисты придали ей огромное значение и писали о прокате как о своего рода подвиге. А сама Аня на вопрос о поломке коньков на интервью спокойно ответила, что была к этому готова, потому что это не первый случай в ее жизни. Казалось бы, подчеркни свой успех, коль ему уже приписали статус подвига, ан нет - ей это не нужно, потому что она пришла к золоту исключительно за счет своего таланта и огромного труда, а не случайно удавшегося подвига. Браво, Анна!"
"Trusova did her best and landed multiple quads, but this performance truly deserves gold medal. She also landed two quads and her elegance on ice is what this sport is all about! The best performance in Olympic history, in my opinion."
"Whenever people ask me why I supported Anna so relentlessly and held such strong belief that she was Champion material, I  based it on her humble yet strong willed character. If you keep up with Russian skating, she was constantly bullied by the press, and her place in the Olympic team was hanging in the threads despite being Champion on multiple occasions, yet she remained dignified in her manner. She asserts that her job is not to speculate on matters and decisions, but it is to simply skate well. That kind of character brings people places, and she is pure evidence of resiliency. Her winning the Gold was very significant because she was constantly put down, and her sheer will carried her to the top of the podium because truthfully even she knew that she wasn't the public nor coaching team favourite."
"Раньше была не согласна что она первая. Не знаю что изменилось, но сейчас смотрю и понимаю что ошибалась. Аня великолепна!"
"Смотрю выступление Анечки наверное сотый раз и хочется смотреть и смотреть выступление. Умница,трудоголик,заслуженное олимпийское золото! Молодец!!!"
"Какой Глейхенгауз молодец! С Аней у него невероятная творческая связь!!! Это так видно! Молодец, его поддержка этой девочки, дорогого стоит!"
"У этой хрупкой девочки стальной характер, видно сразу пришла побеждать! Ничего более, ни соплей и не другое...  У нее все прелести девичий красоты и достойности. Покорила меня своим талантом, харизмой!"
Anna truly deserved her win
"Aw, lol. I love her smile, she's so cute. See, now that's a 'full' skate. It wasn't just skating around between jumps, it was actually artistic."
Просто восхищаюсь умение Анны собраться и в нужный момент выдать мощнейший и чистейший прокат!
"After watching a lot of reels about the controversy of 1st and 2nd place now when I saw both of their performances
I can understand why she got 1st place. Her performance is way better and smoother."
"Боже, пересматриваю этот ролик и ловлю себя на мысли, что когда начинается сам бал, она мысленно посылает : все, вам хана, здесь я королева, я прошла через такое и я не сломалась, не сдамся и всех вас покорю! Это мой трон и я его никому не отдам! Сногшибательная девушка, давно ее поклонница и смотрю ее программы со слезами и    замиранием сердца!"
"Анечка, поздравляю! Ты создала на этой олимпиаде два шедевра мирового фигурного катания, которые люди будут пересматривать на протяжении многих лет. Ты делаешь мир красивее и добрее не только своими прекрасными выступлениями, а и своим поведением вне ледовой арены. Восхищаюсь тобой не только как спортсменкой, а и как человеком. Оставайся такой же нежной, тактичной, целеустремленной, артистичной, эрудированной."
"Умная,достойная всех похвал,прокатала как надо,пересматриваю прокат,и как будто впервые,когда во время О И ,оговаривали,когда по времени и очерёдности будет  Аня выступать и я неслась домой после работы что б успеть не ее выступление,не раздевавшись,я брякнулась на диван и стала смотреть,ну,я вовремя все успела и долго ,да и сейчас не успокоилась от увиденного,всё во мне будоражило,молодец,ещё  и ещё раз говорю❤"
АННА ЩЕРБАКОВА просто  уникальная фигуристка. Восхищаюсь тобой девочка. Люблю! Достойна  Олимпийской золотой медали! БРАВО!
It’s been a year since her incredible performance who sure deserved the gold medal and how she was proud of herself at the end of the performance 🫶🏻
"Анечка - просто  Богиня фигурного катания!!! 
Хрупкая, грациозная, почти хрустальная ... и в то же время с очень сильным стержнем внутри!  Браво!!!"
"I was so happy for Anna!! She deserved the gold medal. I have followed her since 2018 Grand Prix where she fell several times and everyone doubted her. She was the first Russian woman to land the quad jump in training, but broke her leg later which allowed Trusova to get credit for being the first Russian woman to land the quad. Then Valieva arrived and overshadowed Anna. Anna has always kept a gracious and dignified manner regardless whether she wins."
"Как ни раз показывала нам Олимпиада выигрывает тот лидер, кто выступает на своем максимуме. Саша была хороша, но если бы она выступила идеально  итог был бы конечно другим. Я откровенно болела за Аню и не думала, что она выиграет. Все ставили на Сашу или Камилу, но только не на нее. Она большая умничка и трудяга, конечно как и все фигуристы. Но в тот день она собралась и ее катание было безусловно лучшим."
"The choreography, the expressions, everything was just amazing"
Don't get immersed in the artistry only. You may miss the jumps. The 1st half of the free programme is so mesmerizing! She deserves the 🥇. World no.1 and Olympic Champion Anna Shcherbakova.
"Анечка- наше российское сокровище, само совершенство, это идеал в фигурном катании. Эту программу хочется пересматривать и получать наслаждение."
Her performance was so elegant and graceful. She really deserved that gold medal!!!!🤩
"Наверное, это лучшее выступление на ОИ. Здесь всё, и техника, и пластичность, и гибкость и артистизм, и красота. Что-то невероятное, что-то божественное. Можно пересматривать вечно!!! Просто бриллиант ФК!!!"
"Happy for Anna to present such a flawless, wonderful performance."
"Невероятная трудяга, потрясающее умение собрать всю волю в кулак, не дрогнуть и выдавать блестящие прокаты. Анечка заслужила это золото! Поздравляю тебя, желаю быть на высоте всегда!"
I will never ever get tired of watching this performance. Never.
"Its been two years and pepole still think she didint deserve the win , she defenetely deservd it , and i support both anna and alexandera , we need to get over this!!"
A wonderful piece of art which will last long for sure. Thank you Anna for showing us the beauty of this sport.
"In last years, she is one of the best skaters. The quality, music, expression everything she does is amazing! Gold is your colour Anna 🤩❤"
"This program is perfection: the music mix ending with Mozart' s Lacrimosa, the jumps,coreography, artistry ... just wonderful!!!!"
Эта девушка - сама Нежность. Спасибо ей и тренерам. Будем любить вас.
"Was missing Anya’s skating so much and decided to watch this program again .😻 Such a deserved Gold medal, what an incredible work of art this program is."
She deserve to win. The way she performed so well with her flexible and amazing body movements.
Love that her skate tells a story. Very appreciated!
"Аня !!!!!! Четверной под скрипку )) Божественно , несравнимо ни с кем !!!  И потрясающая сила духа !!!  Все на отлично !!"
Анечка жаныммммм менің. Перевод душа моя. Как я радовалась когда ты получила золото. Столько труда вложила. Заслуженная победа. Чемпионка наша. Привет из Казахстана
Wow! I can’t take my eyes away from her performance. She is absolutely deserved the gold medal 🥇
Пересматриваю эту программу постоянно!!! Аня - восторг!!!!!!!
"Великолепная актриса, супер фигуристка! Браво, Аня! Ты просто Чудо!"
Какие красивые обе программы у Ани.Прыжки просто вплетены в выступление.Настоящее мастерство хореографа и фигуристки.
I know I’m a fan of Sasha but I keep seeing these negative comments about Anna and it’s not nice so she deserves to win I have to say her performance was rlly clean
"i love sasha but she tottaly deserved the gold medal, this program is a masterpice"
"her performance was absolutely magnificent. it was like watching an amazingly articulated ballet recital. as a dancer myself, she totally deserves this first place. there was literally elegance flowing through her, wanting everyone to keep watching. she's like a swan but on ice. very beautiful, I was taken aback by this mesmerising performance."
"Je trouve Anna Shcherbakova très agréable à regarder car elle suit la musique (j'aime la musique de ce programme comme celle du programme court), son programme est beau, ses gestes sont gracieux, ses bras sont ceux d'une ballerine. Elle-même est belle et élégante. Bravo à elle!"
Анна - наше золотое достояние! Она прекрасна! Как русская берёзка родная и такая стойкая!
"Браво Аннушка!!!!
Восхитительная Анна справилась с таким накалом страстей и стала первой, и не просто первой, а Олимпийской Чемпионкой."
"She deserve to win gold medal for sure 
When it comes to giving points everything counts not only how many they have done quads, this winner has gave her heart on performance her expressions and less mistakes it was mind blowing performance"
"Какая шикарная программа и невероятная, артистичная, грациозная Анна с несгибаемым характером.
Именно такими качествами обладают олимпийские чемпионы."
"Undefeated and unbroken.  Wishing Anna the best in future. Shine on, let your brilliance shine on beautiful star 🌟"
"Сколько изящности, пластики и артистизма! Смотрю каждый раз, затаив дыхание. Анечка - как распускающийся цветок! Она живет, ТВОРИТ на льду. Потрясающе!"
"For people dont understand how she 1st it is the emotion that she put in thus skates, her graceful skating making it look clean and the techinc she had"
The Olympic champion! Anna is one of the best figure skaters I’ve ever seen.
"Anna always delivers! I'm a Sasha's fan, but gotta admit that this girl always pulls through whenever it counts. Truly respect her for that. Congrats on this well-deserved medal 👍🥇"
"Fantastica. She did a perfect program, any mistake. Wonderful. She worked so hard to arrive here and she won. Brava"
"Золотой фонд от Анны Шербаковой.Каждое выступление шедевр.Я думал ,что Челябинск не превзойти.Но Маргарита в Пекине от  нечто.У Анны это театр на льду."
"ноябрь 2024. Пооизвольная Анны просто сплошные эмоции. За ними даже не видно напряжения: всё так плавно и музыкально. Про выражение на лице даже не говорю (настоящая актриса!❤). Танец, техника, музыка - всё прекрасно!
Хотела сказать, что короткая не была такой впечатляющей😊. Здесь артистизм просто зашкаливает (техника тоже не подвела😊)"
"Anya is my favourite figure skater, she’s so talented and beautiful. Sending love all the way from Canada!🇨🇦"
She got so much hate before the Olympics too with people saying she shouldn't even be on the team. That made this incredible performance even more gratifying.
"Wow,  now that's how U skate in the clutch, that's how U skate for Olympic Gold 🏅. Anna has truly become one of the all time great in the sport of figure skating."
Неповторимая Анна Щербакова ❤
"Самая потрясающая от первой ноты до последней!!!Настоящая  Олимпийская чемпионка!!! Я верила, я знала!!!"
It is so hard to perform two clean programs under so much pressure. What a warrior!
Ну какая же Аня классная и красивая! Как хороша!!!
"From all Olympic figure skating, this is a performance I keep repeating watching, other than Kim Yuna's 2010 performance. Just a joy to watch."
i was not convinced by her selection but i m really convinced by her title! she was flawless with difficult jumps and beautiful artistry. well deserved gold medal
Anna gives the impression that she is a genuinely nice young woman and works hard and is a fierce competitor.   She deserved her gold.
"I am not even close to Both of their performance, i mean for me its like a dream. But look at Anna, she do it very gracefully, after every exotic move, she didn’t lose her balance, which sasha lacks. Anna was like performing a play on that ice skating, she is enjoying, its is peaceful even to watch. On the other hand, sash was just doing very hard stunts and keep losing her balance. So totally deserving winner she is🎉❤"
"Даже недруги оценили ее талант.
Это справедливо
она заслужила.
МОЛОДЕЦ так держать!!!!"
Смотрю ее произвольную несколько раз   Она эталон олимпийской чемпионки   Красавица нежная элегантная  воспитанная сплошное. Ми ми ми    Лучшая из лучших
"От Аниных прокатов дух захватывает, до чего же артистичная, грациозная, невероятная Анна!!!"
"Anna a skater who shows security who shows firmness, a very clean routine with a lot of technique, too much quality,  It is classic Anna, she is a gladiator, her capacity and mental strength in difficult moments is evident"
"Прошёл год с Олимпийских игр, а я до сих пор пересматриваю это изящную программу и ещё больше восхищаюсь Аннушкой! Аня ты королева это Олимпиады, ты самая лучшая🥇🥇🥇."
"Прошло полгода...А восхищение от проката не проходит...Номер великолепен,исполнение-шедевральное,Анна была безупречна в свой звездный час,который наступил в самый ответственный момент спортивной жизни... Аплодирую  за доставленное наслаждение👏👏👏"
"Артистична, элегантна, интеллигента, красива, просто восторг!!!"
"wow this is an absolutely incredible performance, the jumps are sooo extremely clean"
Amazing! She was almost perfect! Anna deserved to win! I can't stop watching this!
Сотый раз смотрю редкое сочетание умная красивая и талантливая!!!!
"Бесконечно могу смотреть ""золотое"" выступление Анны!"
i cant stop watching this still
she is a true performer. so artistic. she dances on the ice and communicates emotions. beautiful.
"Анечка, спасибо тебе за подаренный праздник! Ты лучшая!"
"Аня выиграла тихо и просто , без лишних скандалов. Золото ей по праву!"
one of the biggest difference between Anna and Sasha is that Anna moves with the music which makes it look graceful and mesmerizing to watch while Sasha does not but she has some skills but then again both the women have great skills that is why Anna won the Gold
Это не девочка - это гибкая сталь.Как никто она может в самый трудный и ответственный момент показать максимум возможного.Аня настоящая Олимпийская чемпионка!!!!!
"Смотрю и пересматриваю программы Анечки. Какая же она,всё-таки, прелестная девушка, сердце замирает от восхищения. Поздравляю! Желаю успехов в дальнейшей жизни, сдать ЕГЭ и поступить в вуз."
"Вода камень точит, это про Анночку,  абсолютно заслуженная победа, прекрасное катание, шикарная Маргарита, грациозная, наипрекраснейшая девушка, трудяга , аристократка на льду.  Велик и могуч русский язык, но моя косность мешает  охарактеризовать  божественное катание  нашей   Нимфы !   Любим, обожаем, ценим.  Анночка, это лучшее , что может случиться в нашей жизни."
"I love this girl! She is not only elegant on ice, but elegant in life as well!"
"Любимая программа, любимая Анна! Утерла нос всем, кто сомневался, кто предлагал устроить дополнительный этап с Лизой, но королева никому ничего не должна доказывать, она просто делает свое дело и побеждает!"
"как же это прекрасно видеть не робота,а человека в котором искусство и мастерство красоты катания на льду,как же она красива."
2 quad + 2 triple triple + artistry + clean skate = gold
"Я вновь пережила те моменты, когда останавливалось сердце от проката Аннушки, и как я заплакала от радости за ее Победу….за Родину, за народ!!! ⛸️💕🎖️
Спасибо, тебе!!!"
"Анечка - умница и красавица, настоящий СУПЕРГЕРОЙ! Браво, Аня, поздравляю с заслуженной победой!"
"Я болела за Трусову, но считаю, что Щербакова заслуженно взяла золото 🥇 Молодцы обе"
"Omg, she is so breathtaking and her routine is a masterpiece ❤️"
I almost forgot to watch this video today 😮‍💨 feels like a breather to me.
"АНЕЧКА, спасибо тебе за непередаваемые эмоции .ТЫ ПРЕКРАСНА.💖💖💖"
"Чистейший образец девичьей красоты и таланта,Анечка будь счастлива!!!"
Глейхенгауз с Анной создали шедевр на льду. 👋👋👋👋👋
"I am sure many did not, but I would have bet on Anna Sherbakova before the competition. At least she was the world champion of 2021. And with 17 she had the measurity it needed not only by the technical scores but the presentation, the expressional skills."
"she definitely deserves that gold medal, she is talented, humble and just tried to do her best for herself"
"🔥 This performance is 100% gold medal worthy and it’s the performance I keep coming back to from this Olympics. Not a single error. You can talk about her technique all day long, but this was stellar nonetheless. Visually, her jumps are some of the best, if not the best. The flow on her 4F was absurd. 🔥"
"...Так блестяще выступить после своих конкурентов может только настоящий БОЕЦ на льду..
Всегда болел только за Анну и рад  поздравить её с великой победой !..."
Both Alina and Anna broke their legs prior to the olympics and yet showed such a difficult athleticism and executed beautiful choreography. Bravo 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
"Incredible comeback, from barely making the team to Olympic champion.  Unforgettable performance!"
"I have watched both of her performances everyday, I find my emotion still the same from the first time I watched them. Amazed by her brilliant performances ❤️"
"Кто зашёл сюда в сотый раз посмотреть этот шедевр? Спасибо, Анечка, за приятные моменты и успокоение души 🌺"
"Rating the program:
Difficulty: 9/10
Artistry: 10/10
Choregraphy: 10/10
Popularity: 10/10
Costume: 10/10
Music: 9/10"
"Анечка, умница большая, лучше всех, спокойная, уравновешенная, хорошо воспитана, красавица, медаль заслуженная на 100%,❤"
"She’s not only hard working but talented. She’s Olympic champion🤩
Annushka, congrats🥳"
"She is one of the most exquisite skaters of this generation. Even though her jumping technique certainly has it's flaws and is definitely not perfect, the way she performs, her attention to detail and how she simply becomes the music is what sets her apart. Her dedication to bettering herself yet her humble personality make her such a bright star."
"Este programa es simplemente fabuloso. Ana contra todas las adversidades se superó a sí misma. A pesar del incidente con sus patines, del drama que la rodeaba ella salió hacer lo que tenía que hacer aún cuando decían que era la menos fuerte. No solamente es tener la capacidad y la habilidad física también hay que tener humildad y paciencia. Ella nunca desesperó al contrario dominó sus miedos y sus nervios para poder dejarnos esta maravilla de programa. Claro que es una justa ganadora del oro olímpico de eso no hay duda alguna. Bravo Ana. 👏🏼💪🏼🦾😍🤩🫶🏼🫰🏼"
"В очень тяжелое морально время пересматриваю это невероятное, космическое выступление. Спасибо команде тренеров и Анне за эмоции, до слёз!"
"Блестящее выступление! Анечка, мы в восхищении!👏👏👏"
"Really like her innocent eyes. Well deserved Anna, the true princess! 千金太厉害了，实至名归！"
"And today, Anna is 20 already. Can't believe how fast the time flies. From princess to queen ❤❤❤"
"what a beautiful program!! the expressions, the grace, like poetry on ice!! well deserved gold, anechka 🤍 and as much as i adore your skating, i’m equally in awe of your mental strength and resilience. to go through all the injuries and all the criticism, you still managed to focus on your craft and you’ve done it brilliantly. you are truly a fighter. congratulations anya, and i’m so so proud of you and how far you’ve come 🤍 can’t wait to see more of you in the future!!"
"Молодец,Анечка! Не устаю пересматривать выступление,заслуженное золото на Олимпиаде на 100%"
"Anna did a phenomenal job telling a story through her skating, this program gave me chills. Although sasha’s program was also legendary, Anna artistry was incredible in this program. Congrats Anechka❤️❤️❤️"
"Пересматриваю, восхищаюсь,какая талантливая, прекрасная актриса и фигуристка,всё  передала,до мурашек!!!"
"Снегурочка любиминькая нежная. Легкая как пушинка. Сто удовольствий видеть
Анечку на льду.
Просто бальзам на
душу. милота как
Яоудин скажет.
Всем нос утерла.
Пусть завидуют."
"I am still touched by the miracle of ten months ago. Anya, I love you so much"
"Foot perfect. She might not have been the pre-games favourite, or have Trusova's technical difficulty but it was mesmerising and she deserves it. It's unfortunate she had to contend with all the drama, distractions and noise happening in the background."
"Заслуженная Олимпийская чемпионка. Самая достойная.
Аня Щербакова - это про настоящее фигурное катание, в самом лучшем его понимании."
"Her clean executions, elegance, regality,  poise, deep pathos, heartfelt joy and peace, humility, her eyes are so moving and her mien is simply 👸 no wonder she has so much support from  sponsorship deals, to entertainment even worhout loiking for attention. Brava to this dignified young lady."
"Аня, прекрасная, элегантная и чудесная. Никто не катается с такой плавностью и элегантностью, как она. 
Браво, однозначно заслуженное первое место 🥇"
"Фигурное катание это не только четверные прыжки. Так как Анечка вживается в образ, никто не делает. А исполнение программы само совершенство."
"such a beautiful performance, specially loved the emotion she put into it, amazing job anna!!"
Девочка со стальными нервами.Чемпионский характер .Очень артистичная🌹❤️
Anna is the greatest skater of all the times
"Как удачно музыку подобрали ей так подходит, я какой раз пересматриваю  наслаждаюсь, Аня умничка, золотая девочка, доказала что она настоящая чемпионка Олимпиады и Мира, нисколечко нет в этом сомнений,
Удачи здоровья и всех благ, любим ждем новых потрясающих программ, спасибо тренерской команде, больших побед Хрусталятам👋🌹💞🙏"
"Many people have said how Sasha should have won, and after watching both, i can say Sasha is a amazing but Anna had so much more passion and emotion in her dancing then Sasha did"
"Выступление Анечки конечно же победное!Какие у нее руки,пластика!И прыжки у нее высокие, красивые.Просто Женя и Саша так давили и обижались на всех,что бедная Этери не знала,куда спрятаться от этого.А́лина и Анна они достойны высших оли́мпийских наград.Одного не пойму почему одних так возносят,а других принижают.Аня достойно шла к своей победе,никуда не бегала,трудилась в поте лица и вот из таких вещей получаются чемпионы,как Анечка!Она божественна !"
"Лучшая Маргарита на льду !
Булгаков бы аплодировал тебе стоя
Анюта сделала это с любовью ❤️"
"Моя сотрудница, впервые смотревшая выступления наших девочек, отметила Сашу за ее прыжки , а об Ане она сказала, что она просто танцевала, и каково было ее удивление, что количество прыжков одинаковое!  Разве это не подтверждение таланта Анечки так тонко и умело совмещать в программах техническую сложность и музыкальность, легкость и воздушность. Золото по праву она заслужила!"
"It is so pleasant to watch and rewatch Anya perform, not only because of the perfect technique but also because of her beautiful personality, a unique combination of natural elegance, grace and gentleness... she is an angel !"
She showed us elegance on ice ❤
"Анюта дьявольски хороша в этой программе.) Тащусь от того, как она отыгрывает, как точно попадает в музыку! Не устаю пересматривать<3"
"No one can skate with so much beauty, grace and perfection like Anna 🌹She is absolutely stunning and overwhelming ❤ What a phantastic lady, what a beauty, what an artist on ice ❣"
"She skates with so much grace. If someone watched her for the first time, they’d think that this jump content is easy with the flow that she has on all of her jumps, not realizing that she’s jumping 2 QUADS 😳😳 The second 4F especially looked easy for her wow"
"Очень музыкальная Аня, чувствует музыку, ритм и передает настроение"
"Это такая прекрасная программа и такой прекрасный прокат! Еще раз поздравляю, Олимпийская Чемпионка!"
Never doubt Anna Shcherbakova.  She’s a true competitor and always delivers when it matters!
"Изящная, эмоциональная, техничная."
"Хочется смотреть беконечно, спасибо Анечка за твой труд."
"I really proud of you Anya❤️
You always did your best. 
I love your beauty, wisdom, kindness, politeness, everything. You deserve a gold medal.
Congratulations on the Olympic champion !!!
From Japan 🇯🇵❤️"
Anna was brilliant! Our new Olympic champion <3
"Такая лёгкость, воздушность, утонченность, грация и потрясающий потенциал. 
Любим бесконечно. 🤍"
Anna is my idol! She’s so graceful and talented!
"Анечка моя любимая фигуристка. Много  раз пересматриваю её программы. Она ,действительно,  танцует между прыжками. Так была рада, когда она стала олимпийской чемпионкой. Как будто, это мои дети победили."
"she has the grace of a ballerina, the flow of her routine is as gracious as a water. and it’s lovely to see her do what she loves the most ever since she was a kid, dancing ♥️"
"Анна неподражаема, великолепна! А какой заклон в конце второй части!"
"It is unlikely that we will see anything better.  People it  is history,  watch and  enjoy!"
She definitely deserved the gold medal
Самая красивая программа по фигурному катанию.  Музыка- потрясающая! Исполнение- великолепное! Просто браво!
"Все прекрасно в этой девушке. Когда грустно, пересматриваю программы Алины и Анны."
probably watched this like a 100 times by now bro like everything is so smooth and the way she moves with the music is so perfect tbhh this performance might not have 5 quads but its definitely much more entertaining and artistic and exactly defines FIGURE skating. ANNA SHCHERBAKOVA ON TOP ALWAYSS❤✊
"Какое проникновенное  катание! Музыкально, трогательно, душещипательно!  Все гармонично и красиво!   Девочка - образец совершенства, любуюсь, пересматриваю ее великолепное катание и получаю огромное наслаждение."
"Смотреть на Анечку ,удовольствие она и катается и живёт своей ролью,как актриса только на коньках ,Браво!!!💓👋👋💞👍"
"I came from sashas comment , i didnt expect such an glorious performance, simply perfection"
"Из всего проката особенно помню тот  легендарный момент, когда Аня встала в финальную позу, и Глейхенгауз за бортом наклонился синхронно с ней 🥹❤️‍🔥✨"
"Today, I learned that ice skating is a favorite sport of angels."
Шикарное выступление! Заслуженная победа.
"She is simply gorgeous! The best skater ever for me 🥇❤ she has elegance and powerful energy inside, so happy for her! How much pressure she felt after Russian Nationals and short at Europeans, and despite injuries and all of that negative talks she has delivered these sensatonal skates of her life! 🥇❤🍾💐 Thank you, Anna!"
She definitely deserves that gold . No one should question that.
"Я с Украины. Я очень люблю Анюту. Её выступления ангельские.  Чудо,а не фигуристка. Аня,удачи тебе во всем. Ты ангел на льду,я думаю  и в жизни. Счастья тебе."
Anna is the most artistic of the ROC team. The others had bigger jumps but not the graceful motions that Anna does.
На Щербакову можно смотреть вечно. Настоящее сокровище.
after i watched this i now get why she came first. Her choreography and her artistry were on point!
完璧な演技😲👏👏👏も～う鳥肌立ってますよ😲涙も出ちゃつた😂
"Любуюсь Аней во всех программах). Нашли друг друга Аня и Даня)). Так выразить творчество Дани может только Анна. 
Про то, что Аню не хотели брать на Олимпиаду. Не помню, чтобы тренерский штаб сомневался в своем выборе. По мне так именно на Аню была надежда на олимпийскую награду, на золото. Неоднократно девушка проявляла сверх возможности во время крупнейших соревнований. И удивительную стабильность, что является признаком мастерства и психологической устойчивости. Наши выдающиеся спортсмены неоднократно выступали в защиту Ани, а уж то, что Плющенко поставил на Аню, причем на золото Ани в личном первенстве, говорит само за себя. А ведь Аня не работала с ним и он ее знает поверхностно. 
Пора давно понять хейтерам, что трижды чемпионами России и чемпионами мира, тем более, олимпийскими чемпионами, так просто не становятся. Это выдающаяся спортсменка с ярко выраженной индивидуальностью, редким в спорте артистизмом и абсолютной преданностью своему делу. Не удивлюсь, что Аня негласный лидер в Хрустальном и для многих пример для подражания. Уникальная,  с неповторимым набором качеств. Не могу назвать кого-нибудь, кто мог бы сравнится с Аней по совокупности талантов и достоинств."
"Прекрасно,великолепно,не падай никогда с Божией помощью,здоровья,успехов"
The only time I have ever cried during the Olympics was watching  Anna's performance live in 2022.
"Sasha was incredible but Anna, there's emotion, grace and just more pleasant to watch idk"
"Пересматриваю сотый раз, какая программа, хотя нет у неё этих пяти квадов, но программа обалденная, такая сильная внутри, настоящая олимпийская чемпионка, удачи королева льда , жду не дождусь новых программ в исполнении Ани🥰👋🙏"
"the angel is dancing on the earth, thank you for incredible performance"
"She flows so well with the music. Up to the last shot, it looked like an Olympics Commercial"
"Генеальная, стоякая талантливая фигуристка наша Аня .Я была уверена в 100% что она  возьмёт золото."
"Аня, спасибо, потрясающее выступление! Смотрю уже в который раз) Поздравляю с победой!"
"Благородство,элегантность,ум и невероятное достоинство-это Аня Щербакова!!!!"
"Спасибо от всего сердца  всем ребятам из разных уголков мира за то, что так искренне и трогательно поддержали нашу Анечку! Анечка - наш бриллант, наше достояние, наша гордость! Никто, кроме Нюты, не смог бы так легко и непринужденно встроить сложнейшие технические элементы в канву максимально артистичной программы! 17-летней девочке так блистательно исполнить партию Маргариты!  Она не каталась, она жила, она пела на льду. И это в новых коньках, после тучи хейта, который на нее вылили свои же! Забавно было наблюдать, как потом эти му@озвоны переобувались в воздухе. Даже Плющенко ляпнул, что поставил на Аню😂Сволочи.
Но  Анечка навсегда в наших сердцах, сердцах ее поклонников по всему миру❤❤❤"
Totally deserved that gold
Невероятная девушка❤ и заслуженная чемпионка Олимпийских игр!
Достойная олимпийская чемпионка! Тургеневская девушка 👍🏻✨
"Утонченная, изящная ,культурная,нежная,милая наша Анечка❤достойна 1 места👍"
"Дорогие соотечественники - спасибо за прекрасные комментарии. Приятно что мир наполнен хорошими прекрасными людьми, как и наша Анечка!!!!"
"she is not just a figure skater, but also an artist ❤❤❤👍👍👍🎉🎉🎉"
"Божественная смена для Алины, такой Фигуристке не стыдно передать олимпийское чемпионство. Браво, Анечка, всегда верила в тебя, а болела до слез и гипертонического криза."
"Her flawless movement, her facial expression,... everything is completely perfect. She totally deserves her spot."
"Я же не один захожу сюда минимум раз в месяц, что бы пересмотреть этот шедевр?😊"
Congratulations Anna Shcherbakova ❤everything is on point 👍🏻 clean wonderful program🥰
"Восхитительное сочетание движения тела, души и музыки!!! Это выступление - шедевр. БРАВО!!!"
"Какая молодец!!! Каждый раз просматривая катание, я получаю огромное наслаждение и вдохновение!!! Ее нежное катание завораживает!!! Магия катания!!!"
"Вот так выступают чемпионы ! Легко, красиво , точно и загадочно👏👏👏 ну и плюс она самая красивая и ! Что самое главное артистичная 👏👍👏 ну и конечно «мастер и Маргарита» … все не просто так )) на роду было написано этой девочке занять это место 👏 и это заслужено )"
"She doesn't skate. She lives, she sings on the ice❤❤❤"
"Anna Shcherbakova, quiza no presenta el programa más arriesgado, pero sí la mejor ejecución, la casi perfección en su habilidad como patinadora, en sus transiciones, en las piruetas entre saltos, la actuación, la forma de moverse, en la interpretación de la música que elige, que son dos, un poco del Maestro y Margarita, música popular, y  lacrimosa inacabado del réquiem, que suena hermoso, y no es triste en los movimientos de Shcherbakova, demostro seguridad y  firmeza, realizó una rutina muy limpia y con mucha técnica y calidad, es una gladiodora, su capacidad y fortaleza mental, en los momentos más difíciles es evidente, y no es una sorpresa, es como ella reacciona  en competencias, simplemente es lo mejor de lo mejor,  es una patinadora que te entrega su máxima  capacidad en el escenario, da  todo por el todo, con una calidad interpretativa, muy diferente muy especial, magistral,  muy bien cuidada la rutina de la actual  campeona del mundo y ahora campeona olímpica, insisto  maravillosa,  su forma de interpretar, es una guerrera en el hielo, es lo máximo siempre se supera en competencias, siempre es mejor, siempre interpreta más, siempre salta mejor, es una patinadora excepcional."
Вот просто восторг! Да! Это честное олимпийское золото! Шикарное катание и буря эмоций! Аня Браво! ❤
"Анна Щербакова вернула мне интерес к ФК, она Великий мастер, смотрю теперь не только большие турниры но и все шоу, чтоб её увидеть ❤❤❤"
"Ну что может быть прекраснее!!!  Человек трудился с самого детства!!! И дарит теперь радостные моменты , прекрасные чувства нам - людям!!!  Спасибо Ане!!!"
"Болели за Анну всей семьей и очень были рады ее заслуженной победе! 🥇 Анна прекрасная и сбалансированная фигуристка, одна из первых отважившаяся на четверные прыжки 🥰 но четверные не превалируют в ее программах, что очень хорошо ее характеризует. Две шикарные программы💓 поздравляем Анну и весь тренерский штаб!"
"Можно смотреть бесконечно, настоящее фигурное катание, браво Анечка"
Эта девушка настоящая Актриса на льду. Передать три разных образа в одной программе может далеко не каждая фигуристка.
"Я  уже наверное раз сто пересмотрел эту блистательную программу за  месяц. Эмоции все еще не отпускают.Одна из лучших программ  в ФК, что я видел. 😌"
Боже какая прелесть🎉❤❤. Такая легкая изящная тонкая хрупкая гибкая плавная обоятельная не катается а летит парит вместе с музыкой🙌 изумительное наслаждение💗-- настоящая заслуженная Олимпийская Чемпионка и Боец с большой буквы💯🌟👍👏💐
My third comment.  Yet to see a better performance across ANY professional sporting competition.      Anna is simply the best ever.  Still lost for words at her brilliance and grace both on and off the ice. 😘
"Аня - заслуженная Олимпийская Чемпионка! Изящное катание ❤
Люблю Аню и эту программу"
Never get bored watching this program
"Безупречная во всем! Браво, браво, браво!!!❤"
"Наша восхитительная, волшебная Аня❤
 это не просто талантливая, горящая как звезда, фигуристка, а ещё и интересная, воспитанная, светлая девушка, взрослая не по годам, и это с таких юных лет. Одно удовольствие и гордость смотреть на неё🌹"
2024? Does anyone still watch like me?
Походу буду пересматривать это катание до следующей олимпиады!! Чемпионка Чудо как хорошо передает образы!!🧚‍♀️👸💐
"Регулярно возвращаюсь пересматривать этот шедевр💗
Теперь у меня 2 любимые олимпийские чемпионки ФК-по заслугам их!💪 Алина, Аня - вы ПО ПРАВУ ОЛИМПИЙСКИЕ ЧЕМПИОНКИ!"
"She is a swan on the ice. Gorgeous, well deserved gold."
"Не знаю, я пофигист в принципе.
Но когда я вижу Аню Щербакову, мне становится на сердце очень тепло. Оказывается, в этой жизни есть такие девушки! Умные, утонченные, не побоюсь этого слова - интиллегентные. Там дедушка-профессор МГУ прописан на милом личике. Спасибо родителям, что девочку поддержали, и вырастили такую эльфийскую принцессу. Вы только представьте, сколько лет тяжкого труда уже за ее хрупкими плечами. С 4х лет девочка на коньках, один выходной в неделю....
И шутка-ли - трехкратная чемпионка России (а это крутизна еще та, чемп РФ выиграть тяжелее чем чемп мира), чемпионка мира, и ОИ чемпионка!
Честно, я вот просто счастлив, что в этой тяжелой жизни - есть такие девушки. Значит не всё еще проё@но, значит жизнь идет норм путём. А этот лутц-риттовый каскад - чуть ли не самое лучшее что может быть"
"Болела за Анну на этой  Олимпиаде. Очень хотелось, чтобы победила ""старая школа"" ТЩК ))) Эти юные девочки  совершили прорыв  на международной сцене фк!  Великолепная презентация   программы, мощная техника и умопомрачительное катание  . Шедевр  !!! 💜"
Очень артистичная девочка! Очень!
I loved loved loved Sasha's performance but Anna definitely deserved to win.
"Это катание, изящное искусство, виртуозное, непостижимое мастерство! Волшебный, искусный мотылёк, наша Анна! Божественна!"
"🔥ANNA the PHOENIX🔥
Congratulations to the new queen!"
Лучшая программа за всю историю фигурного катания!!!
"Аня, ты Чудо!!!! У меня нет слов!!!!! Браво!!!!!"
Гениальная девочка! Фантастическое выступление!
Такое выступление можно смотреть бесконечно! Блестяще! Высокий класс! Трусова отдыхает!
"Абсолютно заслуженная победа 🤩🤩😍😍😍 и технически, и артистично, все как надо с душой 🙂💐💐💐💐"
"素晴らしすぎる。
ジャンプやスピンの技術的な面はもちろんだけど、美しく流れるようなステップや音楽との一体感。スケートが大好きで氷に愛されていることがこの演技で十分伝わる。彼女こそ世界一に相応しいスケーターです。おめでとう！"
"Какая же Аня молодец! Прокат на максимум, все в превосходной степени!"
"Two quad flips, one of the hardest quad jumps, not even Kamila Valieva can do a Quad Flip. She also did a 3lz,3lo combination, the hardest triple-triple jump combination you can do."
Смотрю и любуюсь Анютой она  достойна этой победы что касается написанного негатива то это просто человеческая зависть. Подумайте сколько лет труда и сил вложено в эту медаль
"анна щербакоба фигуристка, проявляющая уверенность, проявляющая твердость, очень чистое упражнение, с большой техникой, слишком высоким качеством.Это классическая Анна, она гладиатор, ее работоспособность и сила духа в трудные минуты очевидны.Это неудивительно, именно так он реагирует на соревновательные мероприятия, он просто лучший из лучших.наличие фигуристов, которые выкладываются на полную мощность на олимпийских соревнованиях.Отдавать все за все, просто позволяя побеждать лучшим, в конечном итоге не имеет большего значения, чем сохранение того, что они нам дают."
她真的值得這個冠軍
Elegantly executing all her moves! My winner! ❤️❤️❤️
"Such a beautiful skater outside and inside , worthy of being olympic champion ,Congratulations Anna ,love you from Iran 🇮🇷  ❤ 🇷🇺"
"She did own her win 🥇✨ it’s a masterpiece 
Shame for everyone who didn’t let her enjoy her winning"
"Какая хрупкая но очень сильная девочка, заслуженная золотая медаль, желаю Анечке здоровья и прекрасных программ, 👋🌹🙏💞"
"Моя любимая фигуристка, смотрю уже который раз ♥️"
Красавица! Эту программу я раз пять пересматривала. Шедевр!
She deserves a gold medal.
Блестяще! Невероятно сильно и красиво! Аж дух захватывает от катанья Анны.Браво.Молодец.
"Отлично, много раз смотрю и удивляюсь сколько силы в этом человеке и смелости."
I don't get the haters. Shcherbakova is a rock star
She definitely deserved to win.
"не ну конечно в Анюте всё- нежность,  красота, плавность, какие выезды, ЭТО олимпийский прокат. Зря Саша плакала,  у Саши только прыжки и то не все чистые.  А еще очень нравится это платье Ани, такая  вкусная смородинка)"
"Своим трудом и упорством Аня по праву заслужила звание Олимпийской Чемпионки! Её пытались сломать хейтеры и ненавистники, её не хотели брать на ОИ, её списали ещё до начала этого сезона, но каждый раз выходя на лёд она проявляла силу духа и бойцовский характер!  Только так выигрывается Олимпиада! С ПОБЕДОЙ Аню!"
"Молодец Анна!!
Вы лучшая, я горжусь и восхищаюсь вами. Спасиьо вам за такое прекрасное выступление. Заслуженное золото🥇🇷🇺"
"Как она катается😻полёт , скорость , лёгкость, нежность, самая красивая !."
"Безупречно, блестяще! Лучшая женская программа за всю историю фигурного катания..."
"Не перестану смотреть и восхищаться, и каждый раз до слез‼️"
"Изумительно!!! смотрю практический каждый день отдыхаю душевно наслаждаюсь настоящая натуральная психотерапия просто восторг, такая легкость такая воздушность такая музыкальность она же парит над льдом, и это выше Золота! Супер постановка и Супер девочка! Здоровья здоровья и еще раз здоровья Анечка 💯👊🙏"
"я не разбираюсь в фигурном катании, но знаю, что труслва очень популярна, и что, мол, она заслужила золото. но впервые смотря на их выступления, с уверенностью могу сказать, что эта девочка 100% заслуженно получила"
"Ох, Анюта! Как не хватает тебя в новом сезоне! 😪❣️"
"Anna - wonderful, beautiful, intelligence, perfect girl. Анна - лучшая ! Очень красивая программа! Спасибо!мурашки от прыжков Ани."
"Тут наичистейшее золото,да простят меня другие участницы нашей сборной..На мой взгляд,великолепнейшее выступление Анны👍👍👍"
"Пересматриваю, восхищаюсь и сердце всё равно останавливается на каждом прыжке, хотя уже знаем результат! Анюта, ты космос 💞"
"No me canso de ver a Anna, es excepcional y tiene una elegancia patinando única, bendiciones desde Cuba"
Надеюсь ты в полной мере насладишься своей заслуженной медалью! На льду тебе не было равных 💜
"Смотрю вновь и вновь и не перестаю восхищаться,вот это характер,настоящий чемпион👍😍💪"
Im surprised of how people say the girl who got second place deserved the gold better but i saw her performance and she looked like a robot while anna putted more feeling and passion to her performance... well deserved
"Warm welcome to the fans of sasha ( jumper of this olympic season) figure skating is a combination not a jumping competition if you want to jump go to athletic events 😉 )
Congratulations Anna on this amazing performance and thank you for  her sportsmanship,  greatness, calmness , consideration for her fans and respect her competitors"
"вот это спортсменка....всё заслуженно....Брависимо Анна...что лично меня восхищает в ней вовсе не фигурнокатательные способности, а её ум, который она умудрилась применить на физической практике, что бы добиться высочайшего результата..."
"Люблю и уважаю за их каторжный труд всех фигуристов, независимо от их титулов, в том числе и Камилу, но звезда для мня это Анечка, где все соедин лось: красота, грация, технично ть, образ и просто девочка с большими человеческими качествами💗💗💗💗"
Умничка!!!Первое место заслуженно!!!Откатала безупречно!!!!❤❤❤❤
"А я болела за Анечка, она настоящий боец!"
I have fallen under the spell of Anna's beauty and magic for the rest of my life ❤🌹❤
Ура Глейхенгаузу. Хореография этой программы - просто шедевер.
"I think my favorite thing about her is how well she starts and finishes her jumps. 

Before jumping, she does this turn while opening her arms, turns around and jumps. 0:58 1:23 3:10

After she lands, she does this ""push"" while extending her arm very gracefully. 1:03 1:27 2:16

Things like this really add to the flow of the routine. Landing the jumps is impressive enough, but to follow them up with those small movements makes it all more coherent."
cant stop watching this
Январь 2024… а я все смотрю и наслаждаюсь ❤
На такой скорости  и так чисто   исполнить - золотце  ! Я смотрела у  меня голова закружилась  как можно это всё выдержать ?
Смотрю часто. Такая изящная. Хотя олимпийскими чемпионами не просто становятся. Такая выдержка!❤  Анечка ты класс! Куда круче?
"I saw a short reel in Facebook and was feeling sorry for the red head who was crying and the clip seems sorry for the redhead, so I came to YT to watch both performances. Now I don't feel bad for the redhead girl. As an unprofessional opinion, the redhead girl's first 2 songs didn't synchronized with her moves. I think she put too much effort in preparing to make those big moves but it destroyed the performance, it only got better when she synchronized to the fast-paced song. The brunet girl who got the championship, in my opinion deserved her trophy. From the beginning of her performance I was instantly drawn by her facial expressions and her synchrony with her songs. Although not as many as big moves but overall I enjoyed the performance and wasn't distracted bec the moves and the song doesn't match. So I think the redhead still has a long way to go, she's still young so I hope she'll take this as a lesson when she cools her head off. She's capable but needs to see the bigger picture. I wish both of them well."
Такого нежного и плавного исполнения  мир еще не видел!Прекрасно!
Абсолютно безупречное катание. Браво!
"Пересматриваю тысячу раз шедевр ФК, браво наша Олимпийская Чемпионка!!!"
Anna - is national treasure.
"Уникальная девочка.Уникальное исполнение,уникальная постановка"
Such a clean performance
"Если бы я попытался проделать ТАКОЕ на ровном газоне, остался бы без головы.....Браво АННЕ!!!!!!!!"
"Anna sin duda es la merecida Campeona Olímpica, 2 buenos programas y con quads.
Sin duda una final de Olimpiadas de damas de alto Nivel entre Scherbakova y Trusova.
Bravo Anna!!✊✊✊💯💐💐"
"Я совсем не разбираюсь в фигурном катании, но по моему это очень сложная музыка для программы и Анна просто сливается с музыкой. Классно!"
"Настоящая блестящая олимпийская чемпионка 👏👏👏👏👏 посмотрите на ее личико , умничка 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏"
"Nah bruh, for those saying Alexander trusova deserved the win, i can tell that you guys are just salty!! After watching both performance, i see why she won.. sure trusova had done 5 quads but anna has showed that she could do it too if she tried, but she balanced it by not wasting too much energy and saving it for the artistic moves.. she literally became one with the music and i didn't see any flaw in her... She deserved the win.."
"Пусть завистники желчью подавятся.
Это лучшее катание в мире, можно пересматривать бесконечно....❤️"
Es de lo mejor que he visto elegancia y naturalidad de gran escala técnica..  mis felicitaciones para todos los que la hicieron y la ayudaron a ser. Y ella sin duda
Эта программа и ее исполнение это конечно шедевр
Those Elegant Spins at 2:30 and at 4:41 is where she won. Just look how elegant and flawless those spins were. That's Literally Greatness.🛐
Volviendo a ver está actuación tan magistral me queda claro el porque ella es la medallista de oro
Заслуженная победа!
"Чтобы катать Мастер и Маргариту нужно понимать это произведение полностью ,чтобы передать всю эту мистическую суть 
Она все сделала на 5+ и заслужено получила свою медаль"
"Наслаждаюсь прокатами Анны Леди Совершенство, ещё за год до ОИ говорила что это будущая ОЧ, а меня хейтили. Анна Вы Потрясающая фигуристка и девушка!!!"
I'm early!! Love her performance. So elegant yet powerful
Не зря ее называют умной фигуристкой
"Todas las miradas estaban sobre Valieva y ya la daban por ganadora olímpica, pero Anna salió fiel a su estilo de guerrera y reina del hielo surgió como ave fénix y se llevó esa medalla olímpica, que desde mi humilde opinión es la más merecida por su gracia que muestra en su patinar."
"Я после её интервью просто покорен мудростью, терпением, ну красотой, разумеется"
На это выступление можно смотреть бесконечно! 😍
👑女孩是由什么做成的？是云朵、蜜糖和鲜花，还是钢铁、岩石和海洋？在她纤弱的身躯里有着惊人的坚强意志，再次恭喜这个超级战士，Anya，你值得拥有一切美好！😭
Amazing Anna!!!💫💛🥰Congratulation!!!🌹🎉🥇
"Анечка та Талант!
БРАВО ЭТЕРТ ТУТБЕРТДЗЕ
БРАВО ДАНИИЛ ГЛЕСЕНГАУЭР
БРАВО СЕРГЕЙ ДУДАКОВ
ЭТЕРИ,Ни один тренер не добивался таких достижени никто..."
Now i see why she won the gold medal
Классная программа! Выезды с прыжков у Ани самые чистые!!!
"С годовщиной чудесной победы, Чемпионка!"
Wow.. no wonder she won..  everything Is perfect! choreography  and facial expression is perfect I can feel her deep passion for figure scating❤
Умение собраться!!!!! И выдать без ошибок и помарок!!! Не всем дано!!!
"Четверной прыжок был исполнен просто великолепно 1:25, с красивейшим выездом"
Самая любимая Олимпийская чемпионка! 💖👑
"I've always been an Alexandera fan because her athleicism is just something else. But let's not take away from Anna all her hard work and effort just because our favorite did not win. Anna deserved that gold medal. She was absolutely beautiful on ice. What she doesn't deserve is all the hate. Imagine having people bully you, take away everything that you've done, everything that you put yourself through and endured just because they did not get what they want. Let's stop putting others down. She seems like a very nice girl too. All this hate is just heartbreaking."
Шедевральное катание!!!!
"Не к чему придраться...все в меру,на высочайшем уровне,ничего чересчур,скорость...игра лицом,глазами-актерское мастерство,как бонус... Ах,Даниил...все знал и делал Анне ол.ПП чемпионской !!! Это к слову...я так и не смог проникнуться ПП Камилы под Равеля,не люблю Болеро,угнетающе,монотонно и депрессивно...нет,само катание Камилы безупречно,но сочетание музыки и картинки...диссонанс,и долгие поиски платья и либретто...что-то про змею((( А тут все совпало и...золото Ани по праву делит постановщик-хореограф,можно сказать,второй ол.Оскар по праву..! Браво,Аня и Даниил..."
"Es una verdadera pena para todos que por motivos políticos una artista como Anna, y sus compatriotas Sasha y Kamila, así como el resto de los patinadores rusos, no puedan estar en el Mundial de Patinaje. No servirá para detener la guerra en Ucrania pero sí para lastimar a grandes atletas, al público y al deporte. Y no, nada de que servirá de lección, como afirman algunos, porque los políticos, que seguirán en lo suyo, nunca resienten este tipo de medidas, sino la población en general, incluidos los atletas."
"Что за прекрасная девушка? Это было волшебно! Таких талантливых девушек бог береги, молодец просто! Теперь я тоже хочу быть фигуристкой!"
"Sempre me encontro assistindo este vídeo, novamente e novamente! Quanta graciosidade e delicadeza, Bravo!"
3:27 the way she landed on the beat is just so perfectt
"I discovered Anna for the drama, but she's AMAZING..  ❤❤from Assam, India..🎉🎉"
"это можно смотреть как на горящий огонь и текущую воду,привет из Солнечной Якутии"
"Вторая часть, кажется, под музыку Корнелюка из ф.Мастер и Маргарита... Да , Золотая девонька во всех смыслах , само изящество, сила и несказанное очарование !"
Magical!!! She deserves the Gold medal!
"ほんとに可愛いくて魅力的すぎて、テレビで見た時から忘れられない
前半も優雅で良いけど美しすぎるヴァラン顔切り替えからのジャンプ飛びまくってキメまくってる後半がかっこよすぎる"
"As amazing as Sasha was, I really liked Anna’s performance too! It was unique, a very graceful, smooth and engaging performance. I was truly astonished! Congrats Anna, a well deserved win."
"It is simply the best of the best, having skaters who give themselves to their maximum capacity in an Olympic event. In the end, it does not matter more than us staying with what they are giving us."
She truly moves with the music
Maturity is you are realising that she is the best 🔥🔥
It’s beautiful how much Daniil loves Anna 🥺❤️
Still an iconic performance
"Аня, она действительно лучшая из лучших. Била своими показателями"
She is just flawless.
I came from tik tok and saw both the performance  and it won't  change my mind that she deserves  the first place. Flawless performance.  🎉
this performance was a work of art
she totally deserved the 1st place
"Молодец Аня, люблю всех ТЩВ, но сердце тянется к Ане)"
I really love Anna and I’m happy that she won a gold medal 🥇
Постоянно пересматриваю. Это шикарно❤
"Боже, как красиво, эмоционально БРАВО!!!"
true champion. stood on the podium like a true stoic.
Will never get tired of watching this amazing program. Silenced all the haters.
Flawless…. The face of satisfaction at the end is everything. She has worked her entire life for this. Simply beautiful 🏅
"Наша  Анюта, именно та спортсменка, которая любит спорт, а не себя в спорте. На это выступление можно смотреть бесконечно. Анна большая трудяга, умничка, скромная, хорошо воспитана, её родителям отдельное спасибо. Победа заслуженная на 100% Анюта, мы тебя очень любим, ты лучшая 💖"
"Какая Анечка милая, лёгкая, безупречное катание❤"
Только Аню и пересматриваю- супер девочка!!!!
Какое достойное поведение! Это настоящая Олимпийская королева!
She deserved the win ❤❤❤ well done anna!
She deserves the gold   she doesn't need break any record that's performance enough get  gold Anna dance with ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"хочу сравнить с кем нибудь,но нет-Аня оригинальна!Просто ни на кого не похожая.Не прога подходит ей,а Аня украшает программу.Восхитительно!Балерина на льду.Готова миллион раз пересматривать!💥💔👍"
สมมงมาก คนที่ทัวร์อะคงดูแค่ช็อตที่คนลงตต.ของอีกคน ทั้งๆที่เขาแข่งแบบรวมคะแนนนะ เหรียญทองเขาได้คะแนนรวมเยอะสุด 🎉❤❤❤
I'm simply in love with her performance. She's the epitome of grace and beauty on ice! Stunning! ❤️❤️❤️
"Я смотрю и у меня, даже теперь, слёзы счастья за Анечку. Откуда столько сил у этой хрустальной девочки? Как она открутила столько прыжков? 
Я даже не представляю, как смотрели это выступление её родные; каждый прыжок пропускали сквозь себя… опасаясь падения"
"I saw both her and alexandra one, tbh I enjoy this one more as a whole program, the choreo way way better"
Встречайте олимпийская чемпионка и просто Мисс Феномен Анна Щербакова 😍😍😍💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
"Пересмотрела выступления Саши и Ани, всегда болела за Сашу. Но могу сказать, что Аня действительно откаталась чище, хоть контент сложнее у Саши. Так что все правильно,  - Саша - легенда, Аня - олимпийская чемпионка, наши умнички и красотульки!❤"
"Смотрю сейчас и плачу, это невероятная спортсменка-артистка, лучшая!"
"Девочка- воин. Какие хорошие комменты.  Благодарю . Сегодня 9ый  день после теракта  в Крокусе,опустошение,смотрю Анечку и плачу..."
"Настоящая королева ФК - ОЧ, ЧМ, ЧЕ, трекратная ЧР. Лучшая из лучший. Queen 🌹"
She amazed me. Her movements are beautiful.
"I won't add anything about her skating which is superb, but she is beautiful as well."
It's a phenomenal program! Bravo
"Кто читал Мастера и Маргариту, по достоинству оценит донельзя пронзительные мелодии в комбинации, и безумный вальс на балу, и как крутила-вертела Анну-Маргариту судьба по сюжету романа. Мастера она теряет, в тоске жаждет смерти, покупает право воссоединиться с ним ценой жизни и человечности, и погибает для людей, обретая вечное одиночество на двоих с любимых где-то в ином мире...
Сложно, трагично, и только для Анны эио подходит. Спасибо ей и ее штабу за такую программу. Наша классика."
I think she definitely deserved the first place.
Смотреть можно бесконечно. Какой редкий талант.
Omg she didn't deserve the gold! She deserved platinum!!! Such beautiful skate such clean jumps ❤❤❤
"Смотрю и пересматриваю, здорово блестяще❤🎉🎉🎉"
Смотрю в 2024..Чудо как хороша!
"Программы Анечки всегда заставляют плакать, настолько проникновенно катает❤️❤️❤️ Ее и Камилочку пересматриваю периодически!"
"Молодец
Она больше всех заслужила быть олимпийской чемпионкой,умница"
"Anna deserved this gold medal 100%.
當之無愧的世界冠軍＆奧運冠軍 👍❤👍"
Анна Станиславовна ! Удачи Вам
"Esta rutina me parece sin exagerar, una de las mayores expresiones del ARTE de los últimos tiempos. Que viva por siempre ANNA SCHERBAKOVA!!!!"
"Brava, Anna! Such a special angelic Olympic champion."
"She was just fantastic...
..and deserves the gold

Beautiful performance  ❤️"
Wow it’s is SIMPLY INCREDIBLE!   Wow… ABSOLUTELY wonderful performance ❤.   Credit to her team Danil  Eteri and all the coaches…it was sublime!!   That word “sublime” sounds bad maybe to non English speakers but it means unparalleled and outstanding.
How can someone be that amazing
"People are hating on her just because Sasha did 5 quads on her skating and Anna did 2 quads. But in my opinion, Anna did better. She did it flawlessly like a ballerina! Sasha also did great with her quads, but Olympic is not just about sport, it's about art! I love both of them, and they did great job!"
"КРАСОТА , ГРАЦИЯ , ИЗУМИТЕЛЬНОЕ ОЧАРОВАНИЕ ,НЕЖНОСТЬ И В ТО ЖЕ ВРЕМЯ ЗАВОРАЖИВАЮЩИЙ ТЕМПЕРАМЕНТ - ЭТО ВСЁ НАША ЛЮБИМАЯ АНИЧКА !!!!!!!! ТЫ ДОСТОЙНА ЭТОЙ ПОБЕДЫ ! СЧАСТЬЯ ТЕБЕ СЛАВНАЯ ДЕВОЧКА !"
She won this fair and square 🎉🎉🎉❤
"This is strange, but Apocalyptica brought me here in first place. I cannot believe I didn't know about this gorgeous performance before. Absolutely stunning."
"Дек 2024 пересматриваю Анну, Алину, Камилу наши девчонки самые самые, браво любимые девочки наши россиянки!!!!!"
"Вот фигуристка настоящая, нет ненависти фальши."
"she is so amazing.. no wonder she got the gold medal. really enjoy the song, the movement, and everything.. i could see she enjoy every seconds and not only pointing scores <3 <3"

Лебединая грация и нежность . Всего Доброго на Жизненном пути Аннушка . 🙂
She skated gracefully 🤍
"какая умничка, чистая, цельная, очень женственная"
"Часто пересматриваю эти два оли-поокпта Анини и Сашин. Обожаю оба, обеих! Нпасегда в сердце! 💜❤"
She really deserved that gold 🥇
I never watch any figures skater expect yuna kim...but anna performance make me fall in love with her.  Her performance never disappointed me ❤
"Да, многого лишился мировое фк,не допустив наших спортсменов до соревнований. Где еще они могут увидеть такую красоту, нежность и техничность. Пусть довольствуются своими тумбочками на коньках. Анна, браво! Обожаю тебя, постоянно пересматриваю программы."
"For her ice skating isn't a sport
It's her passion and love"
Оказывается Анна прыгала с парашютом.Очень смелая девочка🌠💫Любимая фигуристка❤️🌹🌹
that gold medal was really meant for her
"❤❤Я снова и снова смотрю этот номер .
Нет слов.

i loge Trusova but in my opinion Shebakova deserved gold
outstanding. thats the only way to describe this performance. absolutely outstanding.
"She really proved herself at the olympics by winning gold above valieva and trusova. Every one underestimated her, but she showed them what she was capable of. THE CHAMPION ANNA SHCHERBAKOVA✊❤"
"Пересматриваю вся такаа,молодец,люблю тебя ❤"

So pretty 😭 such an angel. Flawless performance! Im crying 😭🫶🏻
still amazing Anna.. you will always be remembered
Можно смотреть бесконечно. Восторг.
"For all the TikTok bots who haven’t a clue of figure skating. 

You have a short program and a long program, your win is determined by the sum of both..

Anna skated clean on both (with 2 Quads + 3Lutz3Loop)

Sasha fell on her short program and on her free she did the 5 quads, but lacked in other aspects in which they are judged. 
Hope it helps."
"Wonderful skating. Jump, skate and music are matched without any deficit."
What a beautiful performance 😮 i can't believe all those edits saying she didn’t deserve it
"Gold is this,i can watch this every time"
Anna skated clean and beautifully...kinda like she glided over the ice
"Олицетворение настоящей фигуристки, легкой, воздушной, нежной, грациозной, ее прыжки летящие , воздушные, это сама песня"
"Brava, bella, elegante, flessuosa, soave. Grandissima!"
"Figure skating is about art and her performance had artistics.
Love her style so much, she's totally my favorite ❤❤❤

"Какая умница Аня!На всю программу идёт очень тревожная музыка,но Аня не отступила,прекрасно выступила и победила!❤"

Ай да молочина красавица умница настоящая чемпионка борец
It was like the best thing i have ever seen
наши девочки самые хрупкие и самые жилистые❤❤❤удачи вам девчонки
"Российские фигуристкии - это правда какой-то космос. 
Я лично болел сразу за всех трех наших девушек, они уникальны
Саша ""русская ракета"", самое меткое прозвище.
Камила - чудо чудное, диво дивное, не прибавить, не убавить
Аня эльфийская принцесса с титановым стержнем внутри . 😊"
Заслуженная!!!!!!! Умница!!!!!
"Пересматриваю в 2025-Аня лучшая до сих пор!!! 
Талантливая, скромная, трудолюбивая, сильная духом, красавица!!!"
Мне кажется Щербакова достойна многих медалей.
"Обожаю эту девочку , лучше её нет и вряд-ли ещё будет:красивая , умная , сильная , благородная , с королевской осанкой , ОЧ , интеллектуалка, свободно говорит на английском, лучшая !❤❤❤❤❤❤"
"Талант, до мурашек❤"
"I still watch this performance to this day, she’s simply amazing😍"

That was breathtaking! ❤

Ура! Молодчинка! Заслужила!👍😘😍🥰
Well I love Anna more than the silver 😂 idk why people keep saying Anna doesn’t deserve Gold. This is just magnificent
Elegant and seemingly effortless
Best skater in the world forever but I am excited for the upcoming generation ❤who Anna now supports like a true person :-)
They all deserved so much better.
She is fabulous. It makes me sad hearing what she had to go through though 💔
"Исключительная красавица
Исключительная сила духа и характер
Исключительная вселенская спортивная справедливость...)"
I am so happy for her
"2:36 Анна - гениальная актриса. Представляю фильм в готическом стиле. Анна, нежная обитательница мрачного замка, тихонько жалуется, какая у них жуткая инфернальная опасность. А потом это выражение лица - вот кто оказывается главный вампир."
УМНИЦА .КРАСАВИЦА! Милочка!
"a very different, very special, very well thought out, very well cared for musical choice, its three elements of turn or level four pirouettes, simply leaving no questions in the air."
My queen anna got what she fought for❤
"Характер, вот настоящий олимпионик, достойная победа"
Лучшее Спасибо это лучшее на все времена- Гена.
What a champion!  Simply outstanding!!!  ❤❤❤
"Анечка самая лучшая олимпийская  чемпионка , она золотая победительница  с четверными"
Deserved first place!
"Hay mucho alboroto en tiktok de que Trusova merecía la de oro, por eso vi las dos presentaciones y esta me parece mejor. Alexandra aunque es muy talentosa creo que su presentación fue demasiado ruidosa, pero esta chica lo hace con tanta elegancia y delicadeza que pareciera que pudiera volar."
She's totally worth the gold 🥇 medal end of discussion
Que  maravilla..  bellaza y destreza unida...merece tanto es unica...adorable....
Артистичная Анна! Это не программа а драматическое произведение! Браво! Бис!
My graceful girl❤ Almost made me tear up❤️
I like the beginning so much. So atmospheric.
OMG Almost perfect. She deserved the gold!
Это победный прокат!🎉
Happy birthday Anya. Thank you for bring me into figure skating’s world. Your performances are captivating ❤
Wow! She is absolutely amazing! Beautiful girl and flawless routine.
100500 раз уже смотрю!
The other girl was great but Anna deserved that gold.
Still the best and graceful one ❤
her first place was so deserved
"Я благодарю судьбу, что Аня добилась золота"
Лучшая -это Анюта! ❤🎉
Умница! Красавица! Наша гордость!!!❤❤❤
КРАСОТА НЕОПИСУЕМАЯ!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
"Можно бесконечно пересматривать Анины прокаты на ОИ, это прекрасно!"
"Какое счастье, что мне удалось увидеть ее выступление на ледовом шоу воочию. Анна бесподобна 😍😍😍😍😍"
The best programme i have seen. My favorite skater.
Anyone gonna talk abt that stuffed animal she was holding its sooooooo cute
She was perfect!
Шикарное выступление!!!❤
That’s why she is champion!
"Который раз смотрю, каждый раз она со своим упорствтвом взяла"
GORGEOUS SHE ATE EVERYONE UPPPP
Lo hizo grandioso que manera de sentir la música en su cuerpo. Arte en su máximo esplendor
THAT WAS AMAZING
Love the amazing height and distance on her spins! 😍
космическая Девочка!   ❣❣❣❣❣
"i don't like these comments and now 2 years later i think i can finally properly say that anna deserved her Gold more than anyone else in that competition. Sasha won silver because she messed up her short program, she sold her Gold because of that and i think shes aware. anna has fought through injury and illness and she was skating on new boots here! 
i do agree that she was not graded properly on the techniques of her jumps however. and i don't like how it sets a precedent of wrong jumps and pre-rotations. unfortunately, anna was injured so badly she will not be able to compete ever again. sasha might join the next olympics though.
anna won because she's had the mental strength of a soldier ever since she was young. just watch her perform through illness at the russian nationals in 2021, she's extremely strong"
"На дворе уже ноябрь 2023, но я снова здесь😊. Как же не хватает Ани на соревнованиях. Уже почти пол сезона прошло, но интерес так и не появился, пусто как-то стало в нашем ФК. Вроде много замечательных девушек, сильных и талантливых фигуристок, но что-то всё не то, какие-то все одинаковые, ну кроме Валиевой конечно. А из молодых никто пока не цепляет так, как наша золотая Анна☺️"
She truly deserve it soo smooth after watching sasha skating
"Единственная программа, которую я, человек к спорту равнодушный, иногда пересматриваю. Абсолютно заслуживает золота. Никому не интересно, когда фаворит валится, пусть и с трудных элементов, или превращает все в чистый цирк"
Блестящее выступление!❤️🤩👍наши фигуристки самые лучшие💪
"Завораживает красотой,нежностью,силой,драматургией,глубиной чувств❤Храни Господь,Аннушку!❤😊"
"Anna es mi inspiracion, veo esto como 2 veces a la semana"
Не оторвать глаз...
Милота милейшая ❤🎉🙏🔥💪
Много лет тренировок ❤ Браво Вам
Ее катание завораживает!! ❤❤
Высокое искусство! Браво!!!!
"Смотреть как наши девчонки катаются, тут не горящий огонь, не текущая вода, ни северное сияние, а я его ни раз видел. Начнёшь смотреть и ""Всё"" Наши лучшие, только удачи Вам, мы с вами, радуйте победами"
болеем за ВАС всегда
"Смотрю видео в декабре 2024,всё так же актуально🥰"
2:30 she was a fairy ✨✨
Достойное олимпийское золото ❤
"Это так 🧚‍♀️прекрасно, хочется смотреть вновь❤️‍🔥👌🏻🌹👏🏻🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹!!!"
This is space....  fantastic level of gracie
"Браво, Аня!!! Это шедевр! Смотрю  всегда со слезами!!!!"
"На своей воле вытащила,умничка!"
Аня красотка конечно✊
"Абсолютно заслуженное золото олимпиады. Такая грация, изящество в движениях. Валиеву не люблю нескладная, малоопытная, хотя и очень талантливая. Трусова тоже заслуживала победы, как рекордсмен по прыжкам, но фигурное катание это не только прыжки и излишнее их количество лисно для меня только мешает программе. Аня молодец."
"Можно вечно смотреть на огонь, воду, и на то как катается Аня Щербакова!"
"Прекрасное выступление, победа абсолютно засоуженная!"
Анечка лучшая
Никогда и никогда с ней не сравниться
"Саша заявила пять четверных, но чисто исполнила два, а по катанию Анечка превосходит всех."
It’s an art on the ice 😍
"С Днем Великой Победы!  Ане спасибо за красоту, спорт.❤"
"Та самая,загадочная русская душа!"
Какая же Анечка красавица а как катаеться!!!!!!!Браво❤
Una  reina en la pista..tb.fuera de ella.. tanta destreza  demuestra  el esfuerzo de mucho  trabajo por conseguirlo..
"Она будет первой, всё идеально"
Анна лучшая в мире
"Плисецкая в фигурном катании. Браво, девочка."
🎉this was amazing 🤩
"Много у добра!
В очите ми надмина Загитова ,Валиева и Тарасова.
Тя играе балет на леда
Тя е Световна и Олимпийска шампионка- красива  балерина"
베이징 올림픽 러시아 선수 중에 유일하게 감정이 실린 연기를 하는 선수..
Her skate is so clean
Она прекрасна
"Милая, красивая, лёгкая, изящная!!! Вся Россия с тобой, только где тренинский состав?"
Анечка лучшая
"Балет на льду - нет более точного, изящного и красивого описания данному выступлению 

Хрупкая и легкая, нежная, словно парящая надо льдом…

Кому атлет, а кому красивейший балет 😉 Фигурное катание должно быть таким."
"Алмаз круто ограненный Этери Тутберидзе, также твёрдость и тоже сияние. Пересматривать можно бесконечно. Глубоко, красиво, характерно."
"Браво Аня,браво,браво!"
"Молодец, Анечка😊😊😊"
here for my daily rewatch
Guerrera de hierro! ♡ Excelsa atleta! ☆
самая красивая обоятельная из всех
Это катание невозможно передать словами.  Космос
"Espectacular!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏, no me canso de verlo; la música adecuada, los movimientos y todo el profesionalismo de Ana Shervakova, lástima que no la vemos en campeonatos ISU, los que han mostrado últimamente un Grand Prix Juniors muy pobre"
"The true fact about Anna:
Anna ranked world no.1 and was the most decorated female figure skating athlete in Bejing Olympic cycle with a medal winning rate of 100% in her senior career(15🏅4🥈and ZERO 🥉) , which is very crazy. And  in the past major competitions she has beaten all those most talented girls including but not limited to Alexandra Trusova, Elizaveta Tuktamysheva, Kamila Valieva, Alena Kostornaia, Alina Zagitova, and Evgenia Medvedeva. Obviously, she was the most successful and the most talented lady FS athlete in that Olympic cycle. Many people did not pay attention to Anna only because she didn’t like to create drama like other girls did. Anna is a decent girl and won't act like crying baby like Trusova. She could complain that her Olympic team gold medal was robbed by Kamila, who should not have been allowed to go the Olympics. But she didn’t."
she moves just like a legend of ice if you know who’s im talking about haha she is majestic!
"High class, Annushka"
Я восхищена Анечкой до слёз!!!
والله فوزها مستحق تستاهل مركزها 🎉❤
"I've been watching the Olympics since 1992. For me, this is one of the less memorable winning free skate programs, yet she was absolutely the most deserving skater in Beijing. I was very proud of her and not surprised at all that she managed to stay so focused and professional throughout all the chaos!"
"I can't understand people who says Anna didn't deserved it. Yes, Sasha s 5 quads was amazing but boring to watch, she didn't bring any artisty to it because she didn't had any time for it. But Anna done both, she has perfect jumps and charisma. And this is figure skating, there has to be a little art in it."
"совершенно другое качество интерпретации, очень особенное, очень хорошо продуманное, очень хорошо продуманное в этом музыкальном выборе, три элемента поворота или пируэты четвертого уровня, просто не оставляющие вопросов в воздухе"
"Выдающаяся команда тренеров во главе с Этери Тутберидзе привезла на олимпиаду три бриллианта, дала каждой девочке шанс для победы. Леди Анну не остановили ни сломанные коньки, ни травля в СМИ в сезоне. Она вышла и забрала Золото и наши сердца!!"
te quiero Anna Shcherbakova
"Жаль, что операторы не показали Трусову в этот момент, какой была её первая реакция..) Даня явно рад победе Анны."
She deserved to win
Молодец  аня❤❤❤
"А потом люди говорят, что Анна Щербакова купила золото, она сделала лучше, чем Саша (не хейт) и она достойна"
She had the best expressions and did the program well even tho I like the other girl’s record and how she proformed hers I think this girl’s win was well deserved
people are choosing alexandra trusova because her quads. But they havent seen annas program  and they hate on her. her actions made her deserve first and also i adore both.
Смотрю в 50-ый раз как первый👏
Она великолепна ❤
Анна! Вы умница!Я люблю Вас!❤❤❤
Now I understand why she got Gold.
Обожаю эту девченку .
"she's absolutely mesmerising, a performance that evokes emotions! my personal favourite is from 3:38 to 4:05 . for me, that's when she truly became one with the music, and i cannot stop watching it."
Как все под музыку в такт в ритм браво Аня🎉
"Anna, a joy for the eyes❤"
just spectacular. perfection.
"Bravo,Anna❤"
She really deserve the first
Wunderschön liebe Anna LG Olli 😘😘❤❤
"Compared to sasha, Anna’s artistry was much more beautiful to watch"
Прекрасная девочка
"Эта программа - ШЕДЕВР в фк! Анечка - заслуженная Олимпийская ЧЕМПИОНКА! Пусть и не было кучи прыжков, зато всё было чисто и без истерик"
"Я постоянно смотрю, супер!"
her smile  at the end tells us how much hard work she invested in.
"Аня, молодец! В той ситуации, которая тогда сложилась с допингом, это мудежество так сильно, технично кататься! ❤ В итоге мы все равно победили!"
She definitely deserves she give me feelings she like what she do❤
Гениально. Даниил Маркович  вы гений
Восхитительная Анна!
Умница. Золотая девочка.
"Anna me transporta a otro lugar, no puedo dejar de ver el video. Muestra con tanto sentimiento cada paso, se le nota que tiene pasión ❤. Sin duda la mejor patinadora. Espero que algún día pueda alcanzar aunque sea un poco patinar como ella 😊"
"а тренерам отдельное спасибо и всему коллективу,вы наше всё"
She is Genius!
It's not Anna's fault for getting gold because of her ability to skate clean in BOTH programs. Sasha falling on her 3A in short program was the one who COST her gold.
anna deserve this medal so much more than the alextantrum trolljumpa
Just amazing
"Nunca habia visto la presentación completa, solo en videos cortos de tik tok, pero es bellisima de principio a Fin, todo perfectamente ejecutado, siguiendo la evolucion de la musica de fondo, interpretando no solo ejecutando ejercicios, lo hace ver simple porque tiene dominio. Da gusto ver esta presentación. No la sigan comparando con Trusova, Anna esta a otro nivel 🥰."
I came to this video after i saw the edit on tiktok about trusova and her. I think she was borne to be in 1st place
"Самые достойные заслуженные потрясающие настоящие Олимпийские чемпионы-фигуристки: Алина Загитова и Анна Щербакова🌟🌟🙌.Постоянно пересматриваю их выступления и не только я, и восторг наслаждение кайф слезы не проходят🙌👏👏💗💕"
Best figure skater ever
Прокат всей ее жизни и она не подвела!
Красота как она есть... Идеал👸
Ну это золото заслужено
She is incredible! ❤
Tbh that's absolutely amazing and beautiful
Самая лучшая фигуристка мира ❤
Everyone underestimated her even though she was the reigning world champion ☠️
I like her gracefulness
Ngl I watched both Alexandra’s and Anna’s performances and Anna did much better than Alexandra. Both performances were amazing but Anna deserves that gold 💗
"Аня,произведение искусств❤"
"Anna did deserve the place, because Trusova made history, but with mistakes in the routine, but Anna did a clean routine and without errors, Trusova made some artistic mistakes and in the falls, but unfortunately in Russia the rule is ""If bo is gold , it's no big deal""."
Она просто Богиня❤❤❤
"Заслужила,еще как заслужила1 место"
Красотища  какая  как  катаюца  наши  девочки  прелесть❤❤❤❤
i now understand why she won.
No wonder why she won!!! 🎉
"Китайцы дали фигуристке Ане Щербаковой очень точное имя - ""Цзяньцзинь"" (千金) - Достойная дочь / Девушка из знатной семьи / Бесценная / Сокровище.
Красота, скромность, достоинство, трудолюбие, хорошее воспитание - это все про нее..."
"Her flow is better than Trusova's, and the difference between the two in terms of expression and interpretation is figuratively like night and day 😂. Well deserved win Аннушка! 🙏"
So fast and special❤
Золотая медаль высшей пробы...!!!
"Последнее . Когда Аня застыла в финальной позе произвольной программы , именно в это мгновение закончилась Великая Эпоха . Эпоха жесточайшего доминирования Российских одиночниц.!!!!!!!Эпоха Легендарной ,НепобедимойКоманды!!!!!!Эпоха ТЩК!!!!!!!"
SHE DESERVED THE GOLD METAL??? YESSSSS
Зая ты лучшая
Победила гармония
Just stunning.
Мурашки каждый раз
"Анна победила, потому что фигурное катание это про артистизм, плавные переходы. У Ани выступление объективно лучше, чем у Саши. Хотя Саша выложилась максимально и выступление феерично, лично у меня от выступления Саши накатывались слёзы, впечатление от выступления Ани - качественное чёткое выступление очень опытной фигуристки"
"Watching her flow, she remembers me of Evgenia Medvedeva. If you notice, her movements and some of her dances are the same that Medvedeva used which are very beautiful. I am happy to see she’s the successor!🎉"
Amazing ❤ best ladies free program in Olympics ever
She is like a fairy she truly is the gold
"Saw both Anna and Sasha. For me, I think Anna followed the formula to win without risk, the safest way (more ballerina less technical - clean and safe without mistakes). However Sasha selected the way riskier. It is more impressive to see what rarely seen in the rink. Personally Anna's performance can be easily seen but still she made the scores and hit the gold well deserved."
She’s a winner they aren’t so their opinions really matter nada 😃she deserved it and who’s opinion matters agree which is her coaches 😇
"Анна  лучшая, Россия вперёд ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
wow thats a gold performance
Maravillosa 👏👏👏👏💖💖
Brava Anna ❤❤❤❤❤
She earned itttt
"Anna,la reina sobre el hielo"
"I recently started getting into skating and found out about the anna vs alex debate. I really have no room to speak because I'm not a pro skater but just from an outside perspective and someone just watching for entertainment, I think that Anna did a wonderful job but alexandra looked like she did more powerful and complicated jumps. Again I have no idea what these jumps are called or how to do them but thay just how it looks to someone who doesn't know much about the sport. I think Anna is very elegant and she has a lot of emotion though"
art and poetry
Аня лучшая😊😊

Una presentación casi impecable"
I almost forgot to watch this today
а хореографам отдельное спасибо
Its literally a white vs black swan situation. Both are equally beautiful. One light and one dark
"Comments section really proving the obsession with ""feminine women"" vs actual sporting talent.
I think Anna did brilliantly, and Sasha brought in the 3A etc. and arguments on those grounds I can understand 
But the whole "" oh Anna is dainty and speaks English"" and "" Sasha is too stony faced and too 'strong' "" debate is disgusting . 
Anna is elegant, Sasha is a rockstar

And BOTH are extremely talented young women under unimaginable stress who should never be compared than in technical competition."
Una rutina hermosísima ... Bravooooooo Ana ❤
Обожаю эту девочку ❤❤❤ 🎉🎉🎉
"If you don’t understand why she won the Gold over Trusova, then you’re what I like to call a “every four years” figure skating fan."
Anna is amazing  and very artistic  and very pretty l ! She is the best!
Как хрустальная статуэтка . Браво !!!
She deserved to win
queen anna

She definitely won!
Մաքուր և գեղեցիկ։ Արժանի  է
Wow absolutely stunning just magnificent ❤
The BEST
Perfectly clean performance emotional and so amazing
She won because of the emotion
"I love her preformance,never been agree about kamila to skate after her doping situation and Trusova her skate wasnt clean....the judges doesnt care the number of quads in the programs remember Plushenko en 2010"
Подобных не было и нет. Это эталон женственности на льду.
Perfection!💖
sasha’s performance was great but this is like art like dance i like this one so much
"Excelencia , control ,coordinación perfecta.💎⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
I love Anechka ❤❤❤
The best 🎉
"Un limpio patinaje, bien Ana"
"She's truly majestic... ☆*:. o(≧▽≦)o .:*☆
I don't know why ppl even hate her for winning? I mean I just watched both her, and Alexandra's performances and they both performed very well but Anna really deserves winning I don't really understand why ppl hating her for winning it's really heartbreaking... (T^T)"
"I won't start a fight. Both Anna and Sasha did well. Anna exceeded in emotions and passion, Sasha exceeded in determination and performance. Both of them deserve not a gold medal, but a diamond one."
Повелители льда❤❤❤
супер девчина!
Шикарный прокат.
graceful on ice

Because people are jealous hating idiots who can’t let a wonderful girl enjoy her very well deserved success 💗

For who don’t know what the song for the first section it’s named “ Ruska “ by Apocalyptica
Какая же она железная девочка!
"Anna vs Sasha ❌
Anna and Sasha 👑✅"
Лучшая!❤❤❤❤❤
Это идеально
Marvelous 🌹
So beautiful
"In the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, I noticed that Alexandra Trusova, who secured second place is seemed to receive more media attention than Anna Shcherbakova, the gold medalist. First I also thought that maybe Alexandra deserved to win but after watching both performances, I found Anna's to be much cleaner with less mistakes and more creative overall. While Trusova focused heavily on jumps and impressively landed several qadruple jumps, Anna's program had better balance of technical skills and artistic expression making her performance  stand beyond just jumps. It maybe the reason Anna secured the first position not Alexandra..❤🥇🏅🎖️"
"Anna’s was much more artful, polished and graceful tbh"
"Jadi ingat anime Your Lie in April. Ada kontestan yang bermain piano dengan  sangat sempurna tanpa cacat, dan ada lagi yang bermain dengan menaruh semua hatinya ke dalam permainannya itu walaupun tidak sesempurna kontestan lain. dan ya, semua orang lebih terpukau dengan yang bermain dengan hati, seperti Anna dengan ice skatingnya."
sasha da gerçekten mükemmel ama anna harbi 1.ligi hakediyor
Benim favorim Trusova idi ama sportmence davranmadi ben burda kızdım tamam çok çalıştı belki ama Anna SP ve FS de hatasiz kaydı Trusova sp de 3A ile risk almasaydi belki kazanırdı arkadaşını tebrik etmeliydi zamanında Zhenya da çok üzüldü ama Alina yi tebrik etti ve alkışladı
Ella fluye con gracia en el hielo
25 . 08 . 2023 :          Я желаю Вам СЧАСТЬЯ !
Super 👍👍👍🌹🌹🌹
These Russian girls are the best Valieva and  Shcherbakova
beautiful
"Хочу видеть Аню на льду. Как жалко что её преследуют травмы. Не пойму, почему Валиеву считали на тот момент лучшей. Скорость, лёгкость, скольжение, изящность. Нет Аня лучшая после Загитовой."
A Russian princess she deserved to win.
❤❤❤!!!
А музыка какая!!!!!  Написанная И. Корнелюком для экранизации величайшего мистического романа- Мастер и Маргарита!
Моя любовь ❤ она прелесть  принцесса  королева
До сих пор ещё никто лучше не катался.
"Broioo, srsly... Angelic... U all fcking hatrrs for hating im sure she must hv done great to be on 2 nd place but Im sure this girl legit desseved first... Her expressions, her slills, her style brooo I feel I saw a real swan on ice"
Это программа всегда будет в моде.шиаордос....
"Чудесное выступление!!! Кто знает, как называется музыка в первой части программы?"
Лучшая .
She deserve to win she is born winner
Анечка!
Чистый талант
The Iron Fairy. Greatness.
Breathtaking❥
Все ещё смотрю
"2025, anyone?"
Трениру Огромное Спасибо Вам
"Хоть у саши и рекорд, но у ани программа чище. Саше не хватало пяти баллов до первого места"
Лучшая
Ваше величество Анна Щербакова
"Только Аня показала, что должна делать олимпийская чемпионка 2,3,4 прыжки и ни одна  спортсменка не показала этого набора прыжков.Аня по праву олимпийская чемпионка!!!"
I almost forgot to watch this today
"Trusova did history with 5 well executed quads in a women's program. However, Scherbakova did the best performance. It's simple, she was neater and executed better."
"Объективно, прокат чище и интереснее, чем у Трусовой. Та как-то тяжело двигалась, грубо, а Аня, как пушинка"
2:36 cool finger thingy
Her performance was wonderful and deserved to be 1st but I felt so bad for Alexandra😔
Reina del hielo olímpico
안나쉐르바선수는 마법같으고. 예술 기술. 너무아름다워요.  보고또보고하는데  천번보아도보고싶은안나선수는. 아름다움 기술 그누구도 못할것같애요.
"Он дал нам зеленую полоску,только один из его четверных-это тот,кто пересмотрел техническую таблицу.Не по своей вине мы знаем,что у России отобрали возможность творить историю.Анна,Камила,Шаша,Алина,приказ не имеет значения, просто лучшая команда в истории, извините, я плохо говорю по-русски"
Вот мне кажется аня делает четверные не как все поднимает руки а потом делает Анюта чемпионка❤
"Да есть Болеро Камиллы да есть 5 квадов Трусовой, но по чистоте исполнения только 2 фигуристки заслуживают это , и это Валиева и Щербакова гении фигурнова катания"
ОЧЕНЬ КРУТО
Me ha encantado
Браво  Браво Браво
До слез.
Muy bien felicidades.
BTW she skated with her knee surgery but she won she deserves it
КОСТЮМ КРАСИВЫЙ СУПЕРСКИЙ?!!!САМАЯ СИЛЬНАЯ И КРАСИВАЯ!
Как? Вы так пархаете надо льдом Браво Браво Браво
I couldn't help but remember Evgenia's Anna Karenina in 2018
"Ее не хватает на соревнованиях 
Выступала наотмашь ,оставляла всю себя на льду"
Браво
Браво
"Really amazing performance. What’s the music in the beginning, anyone know?"
"Возможно, тайна этого катания Анны в том, что почти все боялись льда, выступления, ситуации,поэтому проиграли; редкие были на равных, как Каори; Аня была Хозяйкой Медной горы, у неё была власть надо льдом и ситуацией, она выступала с психологией победительницы.  А вот кто ей это дал, откуда была эта власть и психология ? Тайна.  Просто размышления."
this reminds me of Evgenia's free program in 2018 from the  acting to the costume
"Действительно- Фигурное катание,а не прыжки на льду"
This was already 2 years ago?!
Я офигенно рад что хейтеры обосрались по самую макушку...
Her coaches were so proud
Держи мы тут
Молодец
😲こんな美しいシーン、時間、めったやたらと、味わえ無い‼️見られ無い‼️オリンピックという
"Трусовой хоть что говорите всегда не хватало артистичности, женственности . Аня засоужила золото . Камилу жалко, залушили. У Ани целостная программа"
Браво.
Красота!
"It's like haikyuu anime tsukishima and oikawa rival . Anna is a efficient type , she's more precise and smooth in other hand Alexandra more aggressive and so hard working ❤."
❤👍👍👍👍세계최고
Anna sherbakova ‘s performance was clean and graceful Alexandra’s performance was relentless but Sasha almost fell in won of her quads and people who say Sasha had no emotions Sasha experesions suited to the song very well Anna skated beautifully Sasha skated powerfully Anna deservedly won Sasha was angry because her coaches said she would get a gold if she landed 5 quads and Sasha was happy for Anna her best friend to win so stop telling Sasha was suppose to win not Anna and Sasha got 2nd deservedly and Anna got first deservedly and stop telling Sasha got second like evegna madeava I loved both of thier performances but Anna won deservedly before also I use to think Sasha was suppose to win but then I saw both of their performances and anna doesn’t deserve so much hate just think about it you won something that you worked so hard for and people start to say someone else deserves it people just cannot believe that there is someone better than their favourite and I really think evegana madeava was suppose to win 2014 olympics because Alina zagatova’s performance was boring and evegana madeava’s performance was much better and beautiful
😍😍😍❤❤❤😘😘😘 WOW!!!
Милая голубка!!!
Wow
❤❤❤❤
"Совершенно заслуженная победа

Шелеврально!!!!!!!!
"Жалко судьи постеснялись поставить и в произвольной программе Аню на 1 место, ей явно прижали баллы за компоненты. По мне так это на голову лучше, чем катание Трусовой"
綺麗ですわな～😂😂😂食べてしまいたいす‼️絶美ですね😃⛸️史上に残るすばらしい滑走演技✊👏👏👏👏👏👏彼女の今後のご健勝を祈ってます🙇女優❔モデル❔DJ❔現役続行❔まあ～彼女の事だから😔頭のいいヒトやし✨😃
I came here to after watching the 2nd winner cause drama and crying .. i came to see is she the one who reall deserved the first position but after watching alexendra and anna .. i think anna did better than alexendra .. and it’s my personal opinion no hate to anyone neither iam fan of any of them lol
I use this 4:14 for my physics class about angular momentum.

"Bring back the Russian figure skaters, it's sad without them"
Well anna got 1st but Sasha made history
Как маленькая птичка колибри отпрыгала и отпорхала!!!
Очень и очень❤❤❤маленькие проффесионалы😅😅😅
She has more hand movements then alexandra
"Лебедушка,хрупкая,а сколько силы воли"
"Ana patina muy bien, pero hasta el vestuario es triste. Alina muy alegre en el 2018"
I love Trusova but Anna deserved
I freaking love the judges because they still do their jod even when one contestant break a world record they still choose the one who did the uhh idk what it's called but it's something to do with emotion and other important things about figure skating🤩
Заслужено 1 место
She was new boot goofin ❤🎉
She just won Gold but alexandra won World record
😲アンナシェルバコワ様の素晴しさを語らしたら、千夜一夜でわ語り尽くせ無い‼️😓😓😓ウルトラ美少女アーニャ美しく成長しはりましたな😍😘😚

"Бедная девочка даже и не думала о золотой медали,а вот и получила ее"
Фантастическая девочка!  Вали с рф  и Живи.
why does her presentation is only 75.26 while yuzuru hanyu gets 97 95 96 points. Her and His presentation is equal on par tho. does women have different judging style??
""
Карплева фк)железная леди!
❤
"indeed it was gold, silver made certain mistakes few places the leg, the full stop and even you could say almost fall, that certain move after jump reminded than you go becwards no control with one leg spin around yourself from inertia and show was boring lacking smth. here gold for sure, you can feel youth and all that flyent movement"
I love This music first
"Анютка , ты лучшая !
И никакие Валиевы тебе в подметки не годятся !"
😍😍😍✨✨✨✨
Муражки от музыки
"Вот Аня вышла и заслужила эту победу. Пока Трусова истерила, а Камилу гнобили. Вот она олимпийская чемпионка💪 Грация, эмоции, прыжки - все безупречно. Трусовой далеко. Она только палая скачет и все. Нет в нейтрон, что у Ани и Камилы"
Figure skaters are the real life disney characters

Щербакова сильнее чем ЗАГИТОВА И МЕДВЕДЕВА

Both are winners both have their styles.... these medals should bother them..... they need words of wisdom....
Зря Анютка ушла у нее данные ещё много лет могла бы выступать . Худенькая лёгкая
"Alina difícil de superar, todos sus movimientos de acuerdo a la música. Ana y Eugenia que música tan triste"
👏👏👏👍👋🇨🇿
"These girls were all punished! 3 years denied of Any competition,  weird humanity. Sad.😢😢"
RUSSIA IS THE STANDARD
This was stunning and amazing but my opinion on Alexander deserving to get first place is still unmoved
"Как жаль что Аня закончила свою карьеру. Не верю,  что она вернётся в любительский спорт...жаль. 
  Очень изящная, талантливая и трудолюбивая спортсменка!  Но увы мне совсем не нравится её дружба с Загитовой!"
6:22
ЗАВОРАЖИВАЕТ ПРОСТО. И Всё........
"Все достойны высоких наград, но только Анна не допустила падений и выстояла. Какие еще могут быть обиды со стороны Саши. Обидно за Камилла, ее растерзали политики."
"Comparing this to Alexandra trusova , id say hers has a lot more movement and art Alexandra's is amazing to"

"Had they put Trusova in team event instead of Valieva, a. They would have kept the team gold and b. Both Anna and Sasha would have gotten golds lol."

"Tutberidze really  lets her skaters down in the artistic components. You can tell Anna should be just as much as artistic skater as a technical one, but the former has not been developed enough for her to make this skate as memorable as it could be."

"4:32 а разве так должно быть? разве не нужно придерживаться определённой точки на льду во время выполнения этого элемента? мне в любом случае нравится эта фигуристка, это не хейт. возможно, я не права, и Анна выполнила этот элемент чисто."
I just don't agree that Anna should have gotten gold because people evaluate based on how it looks and aesthetics. This is not dance competition and as a sport what Trusova achieved is technically so hard even for men. The speed and height of her jumps were so hard to achieve. I just think it is unfair that people say Anna's program looks better and aesthetic because it is not a beauty competition. How Trusova pushed her body and broke this world record is so important. It doesn't matter if it looks less aesthetic. Anna also did not take any risk in short program and jumped for 2A
"She deserves it, but it's not about it artistic because her performance is very detailed and if you watch you can see Sasha's performance is not that much detailed."

I still come back to this. Anna skated beautifully. She deserved the win. I’m happy Russia can’t compete for what they’re doing to Ukraine and their constant doping and cheating but I will miss her and only her.

I find it haunting to think that they will never be wealthy enough to be able to have a state-funded doping program.  I wonder how young women like Anna Shcherbakova are feeling about their future now?  I also wonder how Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov is doing?  Where is he now??"

I don’t know much about figure skating so I’m curious"
"А вот насчёт  таланта я бы поспорила. Все чего она достигла это путём  тяжкого, изнурительного труда  во вред зоровъю.Спасибо тренеру и хореографу, они нацелили все А нины программы на маскировку её  недостатков"
"Watching it, I can tell it has more artistic expression than Trusova's performance, but not that much. The song was more captivating, plus it's classical music, not Florence and the Machine (which is culturally and artistically poor). What about the jumps? Were they as hard as the silver's?"
She he is mine!
I hate how people say she made the least mistake its not about to make the least mistakes its about creativity not mistakes trusova made history she should have definetly won she made history ofc she wil make some mistakes no hate but seriously😕

How did she win if the score was lower??!
"Я не вижу в Ане ни особого артистизма, ни красивой хореографии или масляного скольжения, как у Косторной. У неё есть ум, колоссальная собранность, прекрасное внутреннее воспитание и нет этой шипящий внутренней жабы к своим коллегам по льду. Правильно сказала Винер, что медали распределяются там наверху и показала пальцем в небо. Очень красивые две программы, прошло время, до сих пор смотрю очень часто. Безусловно жаль Валиеву, она фигуристка от Бога. Трусова выступает так, как будто это турнир прыжков."
🐍
her>>>>sasha
Perfect but her dress is so ugly
"Они поставили ей Лакримозу?? Похоронный марш включили бы ещё! На Анну никто не рассчитывал! Тьфу, даже не порадовался никто. Не олимпиада, а позорище блять ничего общего с классическим олимпийскими играми не имеющее!!"
ahha
Не заслуженно.Камила была лучше!
"И все, казалось бы здорово! Но... Олимпиада, в намордниках?..... До чего, дошёл ""проггресс"".. (Британо-американский)....просто жуть!.... Слава Богу, что Россия, восстал а, всей этой ""чертовщине"" и ""бесенятине""...! Осталось бы, ну как, на ""западЛе""....""Замечательными, красивыми спортсменами""...были-бы, Трансгендеры?!...к чему, зачем, и, почему?!.... Катастрофа....и печаль!."
"Uhm...i didnt see anything that indicates she needed to win. Trusova did allat way better, she basically even repeated half of her performance. I dont get it why Trusova didnt win"
I love her she floats on ice but she really does a lot of flutz. All Chinese only cares about artistry they don’t look at technical details
"I have not managed to watch the whole routine not even once.  It is not something unique, something  we have never seen before."
She was not the best. Not in this sport..... So its not fair
Трусова сильнее.Это спорт а не балет.5 четвертных судьи не оценили.
Не правильно. Камилла должна была получить.
Аня не чесно выйграла если прегледеца то у ани меньше балов
Трусова лучше её выступила
no one talking about A;exandra Trusova..she was the one who was supposebly to win gold but they lied to her....she did 5 QUADS for nothing....then she got BANNED... (but i dont know if  its true)
She didn't deserve to win
Не хочется пересматривать
Half the effort and talent of Trusova and she wins gold??? Olympics is a joke
she didn’t deserve it she didn’t hardly do much tricks but riding around
"центровка на метр уезжает, а ставят зеленые квадраты.."
Her horrible technique needs to be deducted for god's sake.
"Score anna 100, score sasha 106. Why anna winner?"

Sinceramente e friamente Anna apresentou uma coreografia sem graça. Ganhou pois acertou perfeitamente os saltos. A arte foi para o espaço. Uma pena.

"러시아 선수들은 국가적으로 약물을 사용합니다.

alexandra better😂
Не понимаю почему она получила золото а не саша .за что
"All comments here is so disgusting. We needed to check doping scandal more precisely and even if two russisan girls were innocent, Trusova should be the champion. She jumped 5 quad jumps and got more about 10 points over Shcherbakova's tech score. They ruined whole ecosystem in women's figure skating, skater's career and bodies. Being naive and protecting them with no rational decision also ruin this sport. I love this sports  but I don't think you guys really do as well."
"Российская страдалеца, все программы про одно и тоже, всё  страдальческое"
"Аня Да!  Но цыфры - у  Сашки 5! Четверных!!!!
Кто это сделает? Я их обоих люблю.!"
The Olympic winner cannot even do proper crossovers. Such a shame! Her skating is just jumping with horrible technique (Flutzes and prerotated and underrotated combos)
trusova was better but this one was more artistic and no the rythm wasnt to the point

"Ну победила,да.Никто не спорит.Серая мышь она всё таки.Ну а  теперь налетайте и рассказывайте,что она  не мышь"
Alexandra deserved 1st place this is nothing compared too Trusova
Beautiful skater but how boring was this program?! Both of them.
"At the time I was impressed, but knowing what I know now about Tutberitze, and having watched a mature, truly artistic programme like Kaori Sakamoto's in the Beijing Grand Prix, I would say this is just an abused child performing circus tricks. Tutberitze and her ilk belong in jail, and women's figure skating needs to come back to being art."
"I don't care for her skating style. Every time she jumps, her toe pick leg is bent at the knee. It reminds me of a lumber jack. At times, her le8 even looks very sloppy during footwork. I expect more from a skater at her level."
"Не дотягивает  до Валиевой, Заготовок."
Не честная олимпиада.Трусова должна была первая место
"у Саши же больше баллов,почему Аня первая?я Аню очень люблю,но тут же правда у Ани меньше"
"For me, her presentation was very simple compared to Alexandra Trusovas's, that was very unfair, but that's life and we have to accept it."
Anna Shcherbakova deserved 2nd not 1 st tursunova had to have the gold medal. She won because of relations .😮
Камилу подставили ради Ани поэтому такая радастная знала что Ками провалит и не будет баротся за место жаль люди этого не знают все думают это вада нет это наши убрали Ками
Why are zombies still wearing pampers on thir faces?! 😂😂😂
"Kaori Sakamoto has three world titles, and how many have Russian anorectic children?"
"Ей просто фортонуло, что на Валиеву тогда были нападки!   А так не трогает душу ее выступление! Даже раздражает ее наигранность!"
Пустышка
"Меня не впечатлил прокат, потому что худая, как палка"
"Эмоции показывает,но неискренне, наигранно."
All the Russian figure skaters retire at 17 because they’re too busy shaving their back hair from all the drugs they take.
Ізящная представніца народа убийц. Фу
ФФУ Щербакова говно Трусова на много лучше❤❤
"Твой прокат на ,, МЫЛО,, Щербичка) всё папулька твой подкупил ."
Weird how the female finalists are way less artistic than the male finalists. She won gold and she spent an entire routine just robotically waving her arms while Chen did extremely expressive and emotional movement. The female competition is at the moment obsessed with technical scoring and has really lagged behind on that department.
"Наверное, самая случайная чемпионка"
"Ясно стало теперь, Щербаоквым нужно было бабло. И плевать им на большой спорт. Химера, посмотри фильм Михайло Ломоносов. Обосрала все ожидания"
